Unlike simply indicating a flexible size via width:"*", setting canAdaptWidth indicates that a component has 2 (or more) different ways of rendering itself with different discrete sizes, but does not have the ability to use every additional available pixel. For example, a menu embedded in a toolbar might show as only a fixed-size icon which reveals menu options when clicked, or if enough space is available, could show all of the menu options directly in the toolbar. In this example, the menu should either be allocated just enough space for an icon, or enough space for all options to appear inline; any other amount of space being allocated is just a waste. When a component with canAdaptWidth is part of a Layout, Canvas.adaptWidthBy will be called every time component sizes are being calculated, passing a positive or negative pixel value: a positive pixel value indicates a surplus - all other component's minimum sizes can be accommodated, including any Canvas.minWidth declared on the canAdaptWidth component itself a negative pixel value indicates that the containing layout is going to be forced to Overflow (introduce scrollbars, clip content, etc) unless some component or set of components gives up at least this many pixels If a non-zero value is returned from adaptWidthBy, this means that the component is willing to shrink or expand by that many pixels. Returning 0 means that the component is unable to reduce size further, or for a surplus, cannot make good use of the surplus space. A call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy may surrender as many pixels as desired (as long as the widget won't drop below its minimum allowed width), no matter whether a positive (surplus) or negative (overflow) pixel value is supplied, but A call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy may not increase its size by more than the number of offered pixels - so if an overflow is present, it may not increase its size at all. Note that when the initial width is specified as a stretch size (e.g. "*"), then after Canvas.adaptWidthBy is called, the Framework will stretch (but not shrink) the member like any other stretch-size Layout member, but the unadaptedWidth argument will always reflect the unstretched width requested by the previous call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy. This behavior may be disabled by specifying the initial width as a number, or leaving it unspecified. Caution: you must either determine the current size of the canvas by maintaining your own internal state, or use the unadaptedWidth parameter passed to Canvas.adaptWidthBy. You must not call Canvas.getWidth or Canvas.getVisibleWidth on the canvas itself inside Canvas.adaptWidthBy as the size is in the processing of being determined, but you may draw children or call Canvas.getVisibleWidth on them, as we guarantee that the adaptive-width canvas is drawn before the first call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy. An example of drawing children in Canvas.adaptWidthBy to compute overall width may be seen in the inlinedMenuMobileSample', 'Inlined Menu Mobile Sample. Note that reasonable settings for Canvas.minWidth should be applied to all other flexible-sized members of a layout where a canAdaptWidth component appears, because when too little space is available, a canAdaptWidth component will absorb all available space until minimums for other components are hit (or the canAdaptWidth component reaches its maximum size). If more than one canAdaptWidth component is present, Canvas.adaptiveWidthPriority to give priority to a particular component when allocating space.

		/** A dataPath may be specified on any canvas. This provides a straightforward way to display or edit complex nested data. For components which support displaying or editing data values, (such as DynamicForm or ListGrid components), the dataPath may be set to specify how the components data is accessed. In this case the dataPath essentially specifies a nested object to edit - typically a path to a field value within a dataSource record. Note that a ValuesManager will be required to handle connecting the dataBoundcomponent to the appropriate sub object. This may be explicitly specified on the component, or a parent of the component, or automatically generated if a DataSource is specified on either the component or a parent thereof. To provide a simple example - if a complex object existed with the following format: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } a developer could specify a DynamicForm instance with 'dataPath' set to "address" to edit the nested address object: isc.ValuesManager.create({ ID:'vm', values: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } }); isc.DynamicForm.create({ valuesManager:"vm", dataPath:"address", items:[{name:"street"}, {name:"city"}, {name:"state"}] }); If a component is specified with a dataPath attribute but does not have an explicitly specified valuesManager, it will check its parent element chain for a specified valuesManager and automatically bind to that. This simplifies binding multiple components used to view or edit a nested data structure as the valuesManager needs only be defined once at a reasonably high level component. Here's an example of this approach: isc.ValuesManager.create({ ID:'vm', values: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } }); isc.Layout.create({ valuesManager:vm, members:[ isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"/", items:[{name:"companyName"}] }), isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"address", items:[{name:"street"}, {name:"city"}, {name:"state"}] }) ] }); Note that in this case the valuesManager is specified on a Layout, which has no 'values' management behavior of its own, but contains items with a specified dataPath which do. In this example you'd see 2 forms allowing editing of the nested data structure. dataPaths from multiple nested components may also be combined. For example: isc.ValuesManager.create({ ID:'vm', values: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } parentCompany:{ companyName:"Some Corporation", address:{ street:"1 High Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } } }); isc.Layout.create({ valuesManager:vm, members:[ isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"/", items:[{name:"companyName"}] }), isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"address", items:[{name:"street"}, {name:"city"}, {name:"state"}] }), isc.Layout.create({ dataPath:"parentCompany", members:[ isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"/", items:[{name:"companyName", type:"staticText"}] }), isc.DetailViewer.create({ dataPath:"address", fields:[{name:"street", name:"city", name:"state"}] }) ] }) ] }); In this example the detailViewer will display data from the parentCompany.address object within the base record. Note that if a component has a specified dataSource and shows child components with a specified dataPath, there is no need to explicitly declare a valuesManager at all. If a component with a dataPath has a dataSource, or an ancestor with a dataSource specified, it will, a valuesManager will automatically be generated on the higher level component (and be available as component.valuesManager).

You can use this feature to build some simple custom components. For example, let's say you want to show the value of a Slider in a Canvas somewhere on the screen. You can do this by observing the valueChanged() method on the slider and calling setContents() on your canvas with the new string or you can set the contents of the canvas to something like: "The slider value is &#36;{sliderInstance.getValue()}." Next you set dynamicContents: true on the canvas, observe valueChanged() on the slider and call canvas.markForRedraw() in that observation. This approach is cleaner than setContents() when the Canvas is aggregating several values or dynamic expressions. Like so: Slider.create({ ID: "mySlider" }); Canvas.create({ ID: "myCanvas", dynamicContents: true, contents: "The slider value is &#36;{mySlider.getValue()}." }); myCanvas.observe(mySlider, "valueChanged", "observer.markForRedraw()"); You can embed an arbitrary number of dynamic expressions in the contents string. The search and replace is optimized for speed. If an error occurs during the evaluation of one of the expressions, a warning is logged to the ISC Developer Console and the error string is embedded in place of the expected value in the Canvas. The value of a function is its return value. The value of any variable is the same as that returned by its toString() representation. Inside the evaluation contentext, this points to the canvas instance that has the dynamicContents string as its contents - in other words the canvas instance on which the template is declared.

You can add, remove, and change values in the dynamicContentsVars object literal, just call markForRedraw() on the canvas to have the dynamicContents template re-evaluated.

		/** Indicates that this component is able to render itself at multiple possible sizes, in order to fit into less space when very little space is available, or to display more information or provide more immediate access to functionality when more space is available. Unlike simply indicating a flexible size via width:"*", setting canAdaptWidth indicates that a component has 2 (or more) different ways of rendering itself with different discrete sizes, but does not have the ability to use every additional available pixel. For example, a menu embedded in a toolbar might show as only a fixed-size icon which reveals menu options when clicked, or if enough space is available, could show all of the menu options directly in the toolbar. In this example, the menu should either be allocated just enough space for an icon, or enough space for all options to appear inline; any other amount of space being allocated is just a waste. When a component with canAdaptWidth is part of a Layout, Canvas.adaptWidthBy will be called every time component sizes are being calculated, passing a positive or negative pixel value: a positive pixel value indicates a surplus - all other component's minimum sizes can be accommodated, including any Canvas.minWidth declared on the canAdaptWidth component itself a negative pixel value indicates that the containing layout is going to be forced to Overflow (introduce scrollbars, clip content, etc) unless some component or set of components gives up at least this many pixels If a non-zero value is returned from adaptWidthBy, this means that the component is willing to shrink or expand by that many pixels. Returning 0 means that the component is unable to reduce size further, or for a surplus, cannot make good use of the surplus space. A call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy may surrender as many pixels as desired (as long as the widget won't drop below its minimum allowed width), no matter whether a positive (surplus) or negative (overflow) pixel value is supplied, but A call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy may not increase its size by more than the number of offered pixels - so if an overflow is present, it may not increase its size at all. Note that when the initial width is specified as a stretch size (e.g. "*"), then after Canvas.adaptWidthBy is called, the Framework will stretch (but not shrink) the member like any other stretch-size Layout member, but the unadaptedWidth argument will always reflect the unstretched width requested by the previous call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy. This behavior may be disabled by specifying the initial width as a number, or leaving it unspecified. Caution: you must either determine the current size of the canvas by maintaining your own internal state, or use the unadaptedWidth parameter passed to Canvas.adaptWidthBy. You must not call Canvas.getWidth or Canvas.getVisibleWidth on the canvas itself inside Canvas.adaptWidthBy as the size is in the processing of being determined, but you may draw children or call Canvas.getVisibleWidth on them, as we guarantee that the adaptive-width canvas is drawn before the first call to Canvas.adaptWidthBy. An example of drawing children in Canvas.adaptWidthBy to compute overall width may be seen in the inlinedMenuMobileSample', 'Inlined Menu Mobile Sample. Note that reasonable settings for Canvas.minWidth should be applied to all other flexible-sized members of a layout where a canAdaptWidth component appears, because when too little space is available, a canAdaptWidth component will absorb all available space until minimums for other components are hit (or the canAdaptWidth component reaches its maximum size).

		/** A dataPath may be specified on any canvas. This provides a straightforward way to display or edit complex nested data. For components which support displaying or editing data values, (such as DynamicForm or ListGrid components), the dataPath may be set to specify how the components data is accessed. In this case the dataPath essentially specifies a nested object to edit - typically a path to a field value within a dataSource record. Note that a ValuesManager will be required to handle connecting the dataBoundcomponent to the appropriate sub object. This may be explicitly specified on the component, or a parent of the component, or automatically generated if a DataSource is specified on either the component or a parent thereof. To provide a simple example - if a complex object existed with the following format: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } a developer could specify a DynamicForm instance with 'dataPath' set to "address" to edit the nested address object: isc.ValuesManager.create({ ID:'vm', values: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } }); isc.DynamicForm.create({ valuesManager:"vm", dataPath:"address", items:[{name:"street"}, {name:"city"}, {name:"state"}] }); If a component is specified with a dataPath attribute but does not have an explicitly specified valuesManager, it will check its parent element chain for a specified valuesManager and automatically bind to that. This simplifies binding multiple components used to view or edit a nested data structure as the valuesManager needs only be defined once at a reasonably high level component. Here's an example of this approach: isc.ValuesManager.create({ ID:'vm', values: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } }); isc.Layout.create({ valuesManager:vm, members:[ isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"/", items:[{name:"companyName"}] }), isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"address", items:[{name:"street"}, {name:"city"}, {name:"state"}] }) ] }); Note that in this case the valuesManager is specified on a Layout, which has no 'values' management behavior of its own, but contains items with a specified dataPath which do. In this example you'd see 2 forms allowing editing of the nested data structure. dataPaths from multiple nested components may also be combined. For example: isc.ValuesManager.create({ ID:'vm', values: { companyName:"Some Company", address:{ street:"123 Main Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } parentCompany:{ companyName:"Some Corporation", address:{ street:"1 High Street", city:"New York", state:"NY" } } } }); isc.Layout.create({ valuesManager:vm, members:[ isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"/", items:[{name:"companyName"}] }), isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"address", items:[{name:"street"}, {name:"city"}, {name:"state"}] }), isc.Layout.create({ dataPath:"parentCompany", members:[ isc.DynamicForm.create({ dataPath:"/", items:[{name:"companyName", type:"staticText"}] }), isc.DetailViewer.create({ dataPath:"address", fields:[{name:"street", name:"city", name:"state"}] }) ] }) ] }); In this example the detailViewer will display data from the parentCompany.address object within the base record. Note that if a component has a specified dataSource and shows child components with a specified dataPath, there is no need to explicitly declare a valuesManager at all. If a component with a dataPath has a dataSource, or an ancestor with a dataSource specified, it will, a valuesManager will automatically be generated on the higher level component (and be available as component.valuesManager).

		/** Dynamic contents allows the contents string to be treated as a simple, but powerful template. When this attribute is set to true, expressions of the form &#36;{arbitrary JS here} are replaced by the result of the evaluation of the JS code inside the curly brackets. This evaluation happens at draw time. If you want to trigger a re-evaluation of the expressions in the contents string you can call markForRedraw() on the canvas. You can use this feature to build some simple custom components. For example, let's say you want to show the value of a Slider in a Canvas somewhere on the screen. You can do this by observing the valueChanged() method on the slider and calling setContents() on your canvas with the new string or you can set the contents of the canvas to something like: "The slider value is &#36;{sliderInstance.getValue()}." Next you set dynamicContents: true on the canvas, observe valueChanged() on the slider and call canvas.markForRedraw() in that observation. This approach is cleaner than setContents() when the Canvas is aggregating several values or dynamic expressions. Like so: Slider.create({ ID: "mySlider" }); Canvas.create({ ID: "myCanvas", dynamicContents: true, contents: "The slider value is &#36;{mySlider.getValue()}." }); myCanvas.observe(mySlider, "valueChanged", "observer.markForRedraw()"); You can embed an arbitrary number of dynamic expressions in the contents string. The search and replace is optimized for speed. If an error occurs during the evaluation of one of the expressions, a warning is logged to the ISC Developer Console and the error string is embedded in place of the expected value in the Canvas. The value of a function is its return value. The value of any variable is the same as that returned by its toString() representation. Inside the evaluation contentext, this points to the canvas instance that has the dynamicContents string as its contents - in other words the canvas instance on which the template is declared.

You can add, remove, and change values in the dynamicContentsVars object literal, just call markForRedraw() on the canvas to have the dynamicContents template re-evaluated.

For this reason, resizeControls() is only officially supported for Tahoe, Enterprise, EnterpriseBlue and Graphite skins, and only in skinning','CSS3 Mode even in Enterprise-series skins, TreeGrid.showConnectors','tree connector lines vertically stretch, becoming obviously blurry and misshapen with an increase of 4-5px.

Note that some built-in CanvasItem types override the shouldSaveValue default to true (e.g. MultiComboBoxItem, RichTextItem).

Bear in mind that the showValue event can be called when the form and your item have not yet been drawn; in this case, store the value for later display. To provide a value to the form, call CanvasItem.storeValue whenever the user changes the value in your Canvas. Generally, if storeValue() is called then CanvasItem.shouldSaveValue','shouldSaveValue should be overridden to true.

When auditing is enabled, every time a DSRequest modifies this DataSource, a Record is added to the audit DataSource that shows the record as it existed after the change was made (or for a "remove", the values of the record at the time of deletion). In addition, the audit DataSource has the following additional metadata fields: DataSource.auditTypeFieldName','"audit_operationType": type of the change ("update", "add" or "remove") DataSource.auditUserFieldName','"audit_modifier": username of the user that made the change. The username is determined in the same way that the OperationBinding.requiresRole','Declarative Security subsystem determines the current user. DataSource.auditTimeStampFieldName','"audit_changeTime": a field of type "datetime" recording the timestamp of the change DataSource.auditRevisionFieldName','"audit_revision": a field of type "sequence" recording a simple increasing integer value If any of the field names above collide with field names of the DataSource being audited, an integer suffix will also be added, starting with 2 (for example, "audit_modifier2", then "audit_modifier3", etc). To omit a data field from the automatically generated audit DataSource, just set DataSourceField.audit to false. Note: audit DataSource feature works only with single row operations, i.e. operations with OperationBinding.allowMultiUpdate','allowMultiUpdate enabled are not supported. Note, audit can be disabled for a given DSRequest via server-side API DSRequest.setSkipAudit() or for specific opreation via OperationBinding.skipAudit','operationBinding.skipAudit setting. <h4>Auto-generated Audit DataSources</h4> The audit DataSource is normally automatically generated, and unless otherwise specified with DataSource.auditDataSourceID, the ID of the audit DataSource will be audit_[OriginalDSID]. By default, the automatically generated audit DataSource will be of the same type as the DataSource being audited, however, if the DataSource being audited is not already a SQLDataSource, we recommend using DataSource.auditDSConstructor','auditDSConstructor:"sql" to use a SQLDataSource as the audit DataSource. This is because a SQLDataSource used an audit DataSource will automatically generate a SQL table for storing audit data the first time changes are made. JPA would require manual creation of a Java Bean, and Hibernate requires <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=hbm2ddl.auto' target='_blank'>hbm2ddl.auto=update</a> to be set, which is widely considered unsafe for production use. Automatically created audit DataSources can be loaded and queried just like other DataSources, using the DataSourceLoader, and using the server-side API DataSource.getAuditDataSource(). However, you must load the DataSource being audited before loading its automatically created audit DataSource. Note, that automatic SQL tables creation can be disabled. See DataSource.autoCreateAuditTable','autoCreateAuditTable for details. <h4>Manually created Audit DataSources</h4> The audit DataSource can also be manually created. In this case, you can can either follow the naming conventions described above for the ID of the audit DataSource and the names of metadata fields, or use the linked properties to assign custom names. If you omit any data fields from the tracked DataSource in your audit DataSource, those fields will be ignored for auditing purposes, exactly as though DataSourceField.audit had been set to false for an automatically-generated audit DataSource. Also, note that in case of manually defined audit DataSource, if this DataSource is defined so it inherits the audited DataSource, all the audited DataSource's fields will be inherited, this including the primary keys. Since for the audit DataSource the primary key should be the revision field, in order to prevent the audit DataSource having two primary keys, the inherited DataSource's primary key will have to be declared in audit DataSource, but with the primaryKey attribute omitted (as well not being of type "sequence") in the audit DataSource.

To simplify this intended usage, the string "sql" is allowed for auditDSConstructor as a means of specifying that the built-in SQLDataSource class should be used.

If no such bean is found (or Spring is not present), attempt to instantiate an object whose fully-qualified class name is the value in the schemaBean property.

More information on custom DataSource implementations is writeCustomDataSource','here. <h4>Field types</h4> The following table shows how SQL types are derived into FieldType','DataSource types when we use an SQL table as a source of metadata for a SQL or Hibernate DataSource: <table border="1" class="normal"> <tr><th>SQL type</th><th>DataSourceField.type','DataSource type</th></tr> <tr><td>CHAR, VARCHAR, LONGVARCHAR, TEXT, CLOB</td><td>text</td></tr> <tr><td>BIT, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, DECIMAL<sup>*</sup>, NUMBER<sup>**</sup></td><td>integer</td></tr> <tr><td>REAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DECIMAL<sup>*</sup>, NUMBER<sup>**</sup></td><td>float</td></tr> <tr><td>DATE</td><td>date</td></tr> <tr><td>TIME</td><td>time</td></tr> <tr><td>TIMESTAMP</td><td>datetime</td></tr> <tr><td>BLOB, BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY</td><td>binary</td></tr> </table> <sup>*</sup>For DECIMAL types, we inspect the "DECIMAL_DIGITS" attribute of the JDBC metadata and designate the field type "integer" if that attribute is 0, or "float" if it is some other value. <sup>**</sup>NUMBER is an Oracle-only type that appears in the JDBC metadata as DECIMAL and is handled exactly the same way as DECIMAL The following table shows how Java types are derived into DataSource types when we use an unannotated Java class (Spring bean, Hibernate mapping or POJO) as a source of metadata for a SQL, Hibernate or custom DataSource: <table border="1" class="normal"> <tr><th>Java type</th><th>DataSourceField.type','DataSource type</th></tr> <tr><td>boolean, Boolean</td><td>boolean</td></tr> <tr><td>char, Character, String, Reader</td><td>text</td></tr> <tr><td>byte, short, int, long, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, BigInteger</td><td>integer</td></tr> <tr><td>float, double, Float, Double, BigDecimal</td><td>float</td></tr> <tr><td>Enum</td><td>enum (see discussion below)</td></tr> <tr><td>InputStream</td><td>binary</td></tr> <tr><td>java.sql.Date, java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar</td><td>date</td></tr> <tr><td>java.sql.Time</td><td>time</td></tr> <tr><td>java.sql.Timestamp</td><td>datetime</td></tr> </table> Finally, this table shows how Java types are derived into DataSource types when we use an annotated class as a source of metadata. Note annotated classes are necessary for JPA DataSources, but you can choose to use them for other types of DataSource as well. For Hibernate DataSources, this is very worthwhile because Hibernate will also make use of the annotations as config, meaning you don't need to specify .hbm.xml files. For SQL and custom DataSources, there is no benefit at the persistence level, but it may still be worthwhile because the use of an annotated class gives us better metadata and allows us to generate a better, closer-fitting autoDerive DataSource than we can from examination of SQL schema or plain Java Beans: <table border="1" class="normal"> <tr><th>Java type</th><th>DataSourceField.type','DataSource type</th></tr> <tr><td>boolean, Boolean</td><td>boolean</td></tr> <tr><td>char, Character, String, Reader</td><td>text</td></tr> <tr><td>byte, short, int, long, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, BigInteger</td><td>integer</td></tr> <tr><td>float, double, Float, Double, BigDecimal</td><td>float</td></tr> <tr><td>InputStream</td><td>binary</td></tr> <tr><td>java.util.Date (with Temporal set to DATE), java.sql.Date</td><td>date</td></tr> <tr><td>java.util.Date (with Temporal set to TIME), java.sql.Time</td><td>time</td></tr> <tr><td>java.util.Date (with Temporal set to TIMESTAMP), java.util.Calendar, java.sql.Timestamp</td><td>datetime</td></tr> <tr><td>Enum (with Enumerated set to STRING)</td><td>enum (see discussion below)</td></tr> <tr><td>Enum (with Enumerated set to ORDINAL)</td><td>intEnum (see discussion below)</td></tr> <tr><td>Field with Lob annotation</td><td>binary</td></tr> <tr><td>Field with GeneratedValue annotation</td><td>sequence, if the field is an integer type (see discussion below)</td></tr> </table> <h4>Primary keys, sequences and identity columns</h4> We attempt to derive information about primary keys from the metadata we have. If the metadata source is an SQL table: If the table does not have a native primary key constraint, no attempt is made to identify primary key fields. Otherwise: The column or columns that make up the table's native primary key constraint are identified using the JDBC DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() API Each DataSource field that corresponds to one of these native primary key columns is marked primaryKey: true For each of these columns, the metadata returned by DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() is inspected. If the metadata includes IS_AUTOINCREMENT=YES, we mark the corresponding field as type="sequence". This information should be reliably provided by databases that implement "auto-increment" or "identity" column types, such as MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server If the previous step does not identify a column as a sequence, we inspect the ResultSetMetaData obtained by running a dummy query on the table. If the isAutoIncrement() API returns true for that column, we mark the corresponding field as type="sequence" If the previous steps have not identified the column as a sequence, we check the TYPE_NAME in the column metadata. If it is "serial", this means the column is a PostgreSQL "serial" or "serial8" type column. Postgres does not transparently implement auto-increment columns, but it does provide this serial type, which causes the column to be implicitly bound to an underlying sequence. So this type causes us to mark the field type="sequence", and we also set DataSourceField.implicitSequence','implicitSequence true If the previous steps have not identified the column as a sequence, we check the COLUMN_DEF in the column metadata. If this contains the token "$$ISEQ" and ends with "NEXTVAL", this means the column is an Oracle "GENERATED AS IDENTITY" column. This type of column was introduced in Oracle 12c and is conceptually exactly the same thing as the Postgres "serial" column described above. We treat it the same way: mark it type="sequence" and implicitSequence="true" If the previous steps have not identified the column as a sequence, then you may be using a pure sequence database, such as an Oracle version earlier than 12c, or you may be using a database where both sequences and identity columns are available (Oracle, Postgres, DB2), and a sequence is being used either by design or because the table was created before the database product supported identity columns. In this case, we cannot determine if the column should be a sequence or not. However, in many applications, the fact that the column is an integer and is a primary key would imply that it is also a sequence. Therefore, if the column is an integer and the server.properties flag auto.derive.integer.pk.always.sequence is true, we mark the field as type="sequence" If, after all this, SmartClient ends up incorrectly marking a primary key field as a sequence (or vice versa), you can always override it on a per-field basis by simply redeclaring the field with the correct type in your .ds.xml file: &lt;DataSource serverType="sql" tableName="myTable" autoDeriveSchema="true"&gt; &lt;fields&gt; &lt;!-- This field was incorrectly marked as a sequence --&gt; &lt;field name="notASeq" type="integer" /&gt; &lt;!-- This field was incorrectly marked as an integer when it should be a sequence --&gt; &lt;field name="isASeq" type="sequence" /&gt; &lt;/fields&gt; &lt;/DataSource&gt; If the metadata source is Hibernate mappings described in a .hbm.xml file: The first field we encounter that is described in the mapping with an &lt;id&gt; tag is marked as a primaryKey If that field is marked as being generated, we set its type to "sequence" If the metadata source is an annotated object (whether JPA, Hibernate or just an annotated POJO): Any field with an @Id annotation is is marked as a primaryKey (this differs from the Hibernate .hbm.xml file case because that is specific to Hibernate, which does support composite keys, but not by specifying multiple &lt;id&gt; tags. Annotations are supported, via annotated POJOs, for any kind of persistence strategy, so multiple @Id fields are perfectly valid) Any field with a @GeneratedValue annotation is either marked as type="sequence" (if it is an integer type) or as DataSourceField.autoGenerated','autoGenerated="true" (for other field types) Finally, if the metadata is a plain, unannotated Java object, no attempt is made to derive primary key fields. <h4>enums and valueMaps</h4> When we come across Java Enum properties in plain or annotated classes, as well as setting the field type as noted in the above tables, we also generate a valueMap for the field, based on the Enum members. For cases where we generate a field of SmartClient type "enum" (see the above tables), the keys of the valueMap are the result of calling name() on each member of the underlying Java Enum (in other words, its value exactly as declared in its enum declaration). For cases where we generate a field of SmartClient type "intEnum", the keys of the valueMap are strings representing the ordinal number of each member in the Java Enum - "0", "1", etc. Note that this behavior will be overriden by DataSource.enumTranslateStrategy','DataSource.enumTranslateStrategy if both are set. In both of these case, the display values generated for the valueMap are the result of calling toString() on each Enum member. If that gives the same value as calling name(), the value is passed through DataTools.deriveTitleFromName(), which applies the same processing rules as DataSource.getAutoTitle to derive a more user-friendly display value. <h4>Further notes</h4> schemaBean implies autoDeriveSchema, because it has no other purpose than to name the bean to use for auto-derived schema. Thus, if you specify schemaBean you do not need to specify autoDeriveSchema as well (though it does no harm to do so). However, tableName and beanClassName can be validly specified without implying autoDeriveSchema, so in those cases you must explicitly specify autoDeriveSchema. The underlying super-DataSource is cached in server memory, so that it does not have to be derived and created each time you need it. However, the cache manager will automatically refresh the cached copy if it detects that the deriving DataSource has changed. Thus, if you change the metadata your DataSource is deriving (if, for example, you add a column to a table), all you need to do is touch the .ds.xml file (ie, update its last changed timestamp - you don't actually have to change it) and the cached copy will be refreshed next time it is needed. When autoDeriveSchema is set, SQLDataSource will automatically discover foreignKeys and deliver table and column name information to the client in hashed form so that two DataSources that are linked by native SQL foreign keys will automatically discover each other if loaded into the same application, and set DataSourceField.foreignKey','foreignKey automatically. Because the table and column names are delivered as cryptohashes, there is no information leakage, but regardless, the feature can be disabled via setting datasource.autoLinkFKs to false in server_properties','server.properties. This hashed linkage information is delivered to the client in properties DataSource.tableCode and DataSourceField.fkTableCode/DataSourceField.fkColumnCode','fkColumnCode

Note that this includes fetch operations - setting this property to true has the same effect as a transaction policy of ALL for just this DataSource's operations - see the server-side RPCManager.setTransactionPolicy() for details of the different TransactionPolicy settings. If this property is explicitly false, this causes all operations on this DataSource to be committed individually - the same as a transaction policy of NONE, just for this DataSource's operations. In either case, you can override the setting for individual operations - see OperationBinding.autoJoinTransactions. If this property if null or not defined, we fall back to the default setting for this type of DataSource. These are defined in server_properties','server.properties as follows: Hibernate: hibernate.autoJoinTransactions JPA/JPA2: jpa.autoJoinTransactions SQL: There is one setting per configured database connection (DataSource.dbName','dbName). For example, the setting for the default MySQL connection is sql.Mysql.autoJoinTransactions If the setting is not defined at the DataSource-type level, we use the system global default, which is defined in server.properties as autoJoinTransactions. At the dbName and global system levels, you can set the autoJoinTransactions attribute to a valid Transaction Policy, rather than a simple true or false (although these values work too - true is the same as ALL, false is the same as NONE). For valid TransactionPolicy values and their meanings, see the server-side Javadoc for RPCManager.setTransactionPolicy() Note that the configuration settings discussed here can be overridden for a particular queue of requests by setting the server-side RPCManager's transaction policy. Look in the server-side Javadoc for RPCManager.getTransactionPolicy(). Transactions can also be initiated manually, separate from the RPCManager/HttpServletRequest lifecycle, useful for both multi-threaded web applications, and standalone applications that don't use a servlet container - see standaloneDataSourceUsage. NOTE: Setting this property to true does not cause a transactional persistence mechanism to automatically appear - you have to ensure that your DataSource supports transactions. The SmartClient built-in SQL, Hibernate and JPA DataSources support transactions, but note that they do so at the provider level. This means that you can combine updates to, say, an Oracle database and a MySQL database in the same queue, but they will be committed in <em>two</em> transactions - one per database. The SmartClient server will commit or rollback these two transactions as if they were one, so a failure in some Oracle update would cause all the updates to both databases to be rolled back. However, this is not a true atomic transaction; it is possible for one transaction to be committed whilst the other is not - in the case of hardware failure, for example. NOTE: Not all the supported SQL databases are supported for transactions. Databases supported in this release are: DB2 HSQLDB Firebird Informix Microsoft SQL Server MySQL (you must use InnoDB tables; the default MyISAM storage engine does not support transactions) Oracle PostgreSQL

Skip the use of beans for complex reporting queries that produce results unrelated to your persistent object model. Set beanClassName to blank ("") on a specific operationBinding to override DataSource.beanClassName for that specific operation. For SQL joins that produce additional data fields, use a special, operation-specific bean that represents a join of multiple entities and contains business logic specific to that joined dataset Note that beanClassName affects what numeric field types will be used for inbound DSRequest data. For fields with numeric types, the DSRequest.data','record data in DSRequests will automatically be converted to the type of the target field, before the request is received in a DMI. For details, see dsRequestBeanTypes. Note that dmiOverview','DMI also has a built-in facility for populating a bean with the inbound DSRequest.data - just declare the bean as a method argument.

It has no built-in server-side effects. For Hibernate DataSources (DataSources with serverType "hibernate") The name of the Java bean or POJO class that is mapped in Hibernate. This will typically be the fully-qualified class name - eg com.foo.MyClass - but it may be the simple class name - just MyClass - or it may be some other value. It all depends on how your classes have been mapped in Hibernate. The declared Java bean will affect how its properties will be mapped to built-in numeric types, see hibernateIntegration','Hibernate Integration overview for details. Note: If you are intending to use Hibernate as a data-access layer only, you do not need to create Hibernate mappings or Java objects: SmartClient will generate everything it needs on the fly. For JPA DataSources (DataSources with serverType "jpa" or "jpa1") The fully qualified class name of the JPA annotated entity. NOTE for Hibernate and JPA users: When you use JPA, or use Hibernate as a full ORM system (ie, not just allowing SmartClient Server to drive Hibernate as a data access layer), the beans returned on the server-side are live. This means that if you make any changes to them, the ORM system will persist those changes. This is true even if the beans were created as part of a fetch operation. This causes a problem in the common case where you want to use a DMI or custom DataSource implementation to apply some post-processing to the beans fetched from the persistent store. If you change the values in the beans directly, those changes will be persisted. If you want to alter the data returned from a JPA or Hibernate persistent store as part of a fetch request just so you can alter what gets sent to the client, you can use the server-side DSResponse's getRecords() method. This will return your bean data in "record" format - ie, as a List of Maps. You can alter these records without affecting your persistent store, and then call setData() on the DSResponse), passing the altered list of records. See the server-side Javadocs for DSResponse for details of these two methods.

If you want to construct a webroot-relative path, then prefix the path with [WEBROOT] (unlike in server_properties','server.properties, where you would use $webRoot as the prefix). To specify another DataSource to be used via fileSource','fileSource operations, use ds://dsName (where "dsName" is the name of the other DataSource). A projectFile DataSource uses the standard fileSource','fileSource field names: fileName, fileType, fileFormat, fileContents, fileSize and fileLastModified. When defining a projectFile DataSource, you can use DataSource.inheritsFrom','inheritsFrom with a value of "ProjectFile" to inherit definitions for these fields -- e.g.: &lt;DataSource ID="MyDataSources" type="projectFile" inheritsFrom="ProjectFile"&gt; &lt;projectFileLocations&gt; &lt;location&gt;[WEBROOT]/shared/ds&lt;/location&gt; &lt;location&gt;ds://datasources&lt;/location&gt; &lt;/projectFileLocations&gt; &lt;/DataSource&gt; For directory locations, the fileName is relative to the directory specified. Note that the fileName does not include any extension for type or format. For instance, for "employees.ds.xml", the fileName would be "employees", the fileType would be "ds" and the fileFormat would be "xml". A projectFile DataSource executes the various fileSource','fileSource operations in the following manner. The general rule is that fileName, fileType, and fileFormat are treated as primary keys. If files with the same combination of those attributes exist in more than one of the configured locations, the locations are considered in reverse order, with priority given to the location listed last. When modifying an existing file, the last location which contains the file will be used. When creating a new file, the file will be created in the last configured location. <dl> <dt>DataSource.listFiles','listFiles <dd>Returns a combined list of files from all configured locations. Note that listFiles does not recurse into subdirectories. If the same combination of fileName / fileType / fileFormat exists in more than one configured location, then the data for fileSize and fileLastModified will be taken from the last configured location which contains the file. <dt>DataSource.hasFile','hasFile <dd>Indicates whether the file exists in any of the configured locations. <dt>DataSource.getFile','getFile <dd>Returns file data by searching the locations in reverse order. <dt>DataSource.saveFile','saveFile <dd>If the file exists, it will be saved in the last location in which it exists. If it is a new file, it will be saved in the last configured location. <dt>DataSource.renameFile','renameFile <dd>The file will be renamed in the last location in which it exists. Note that if the file exists in more than one location, the rename will not affect other locations. Thus, a subsequent listFiles operation will return the file from the other location (as well as the renamed file). <dt>DataSource.removeFile','removeFile <dd>The file will be removed from the last location in which it exists. Note that if the file exists in more than one location, the removal will not affect other locations. Thus, a subsequent listFiles operation will return the file from the other location. </dl> For convenience, a projectFile DataSource also responds to the standard DataSource operations, in the following manner: <dl> <dt>add <dd>Executes a saveFile operation, either adding the file or updating an existing file. <dt>fetch <dd>Executes a listFiles operation. Note that the results will not include the fileContents. In order to obtain the fileContents, you must use a DataSource.getFile','getFile operation. <dt>update <dd>Executes a renameFile operation. Note that this will not update the fileContents -- for that, you need to use "add", or a DataSource.saveFile','saveFile operation. <dt>remove <dd>Executes a removeFile operation. </dl> If you specify both DataSource.projectFileKey','projectFileKey and projectFileLocations, then both with be used, with the projectFileLocations applied last.

If you do not provide this property, table names will not be qualified in generated SQL, and thus the default schema will be used. Support for multiple schemas (or schemata) varies quite significantly across the supported databases, as does the meaning of the phrase "default schema". In addition, some databases allow you to override the default schema in the JDBC connection URL, which is a preferable approach if all your tables are in the same (non-default) schema. The following table provides information by product: <table border="1" class="normal" width="90%"> <tr><td> Product</td><td width="90%"> Notes</td></tr> <tr><td> DB2</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. The default schema is named after the connecting user, though this can be overridden by specifying the "currentSchema" property on the JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> DB2 for iSeries</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. "Schema" is synonymous with "library". The default schema depends on the setting of the "naming" connection property. When this is set to "sql", behavior is similar to other DB2 editions: the default schema is named after the connecting user, unless overridden by specifying a library name in the JDBC connection URL. When "naming" is set to "system", the schema of an unqualified table is resolved using a traditional search of the library list; the library list can be provided in the "libraries" property</td></tr> <tr><td> Firebird</td><td> Firebird does not support the concept of schema at all - all "schema objects" like tables and indexes belong directly to the database. In addition, Firebird actively rejects qualified table names in queries as syntax errors; therefore, you should not set the schema property for a DataSource that will be backed by a Firebird database </td></tr> <tr><td> HSQLDB</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. The default schema is auto-created when the database is created; by default it is called "PUBLIC", but can be renamed. It is not possible to set the default schema in the JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> Informix</td><td> Informix databases can be flagged as "ANSI mode" at creation time. ANSI-mode databases behave similarly to DB2 for schema support: arbitrarily named schemas are supported, and the default schema is the one named after the connected user. Non-ANSI databases have no real schema support at all. It is not possible to set the default schema in the JDBC connection URL with either type of database</td></tr> <tr><td> Microsoft SQL Server</td><td> Prior to SQL Server 2005, schema support is similar to Oracle: "schema" is synonymous with "owner". As of SQL Server 2005, schema is supported as a separate concept, and a user's default schema can be configured (though it still defaults to a schema with the same name as the user). It is not possible to set the default schema in the JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> MySQL</td><td> MySQL does not have a separate concept of "schema"; it treats the terms "schema" and "database" interchangeably. In fact MySQL databases actually behave more like schemas, in that a connection to database X can refer to a table in database Y simply by qualifying the name in the query. Also, because schema and database are the same concept in MySQL, overriding the "default schema" is done implicitly when you specify which database to connect to in your JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> Oracle</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are not supported; in Oracle, "schema" is synonymous with "user", so each valid user in the database is associated implicitly with a schema of the same name, and there are no other schemas possible. It is possible to refer to tables in another user's schema (assuming you have the privileges to do so) by simply qualifying the table name. The default schema is always implied by the connecting user and cannot be overridden.</td></tr> <tr><td> Postgres</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. Rather than the concept of a "default schema", Postgres supports the idea of a search path of schemas, whereby unqualified table references cause a search of the list of schemas in order, and the first schema in the path is the "current" one for creation purposes. Unfortunately, there is no way to specify this search path on the JDBC connection URL, so the default schema comes from the user definition, ultimately defaulting to the default "public" schema</td></tr> </table>

If true, causes all transactional operations on this DataSource to use the current Spring-managed transaction, if one exists. If there is no current Spring transaction to use at the time of execution, a server-side Exception is thrown. Note, a "transactional operation" is one that would have joined the SmartClient shared transaction in the absence of Spring integration - see DataSource.autoJoinTransactions','auotJoinTransactions. This feature is primarily intended for situations where you have dmiOverview','DMI methods that make use of both Spring DAO operations and SmartClient DSRequest operations, and you would like all of them to share the same transaction. An example of the primary intended use case: &#x0040;Transactional(isolation=Isolation.READ_COMMITTED, propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED) public class WorldService { public DSResponse doSomeStuff(DSRequest dsReq, HttpServletRequest servletReq) throws Exception { ApplicationContext ac = (ApplicationContext)servletReq.getSession().getServletContext().getAttribute("applicationContext"); WorldDao dao = (WorldDao)ac.getBean("worldDao"); dao.insert(req.getValues()); DSRequest other = new DSRequest("MyOtherDataSource", "add"); // Set up the 'other' dsRequest with critiera, values, etc // ... // This dsRequest execution will use the same transaction that the DAO operation // above used; if it fails, the DAO operation will be rolled back other.execute(); return new DSResponse(); } } Note: if you want to rollback an integrated Spring-managed transaction, you can use any of the normal Spring methods for transaction rollback: Programmatically mark the transaction for rollback with the setRollbackOnly() API Throw a RuntimeException, or Throw an ordinary checked Exception. but configure Spring to rollback on that Exception. This can be done in the @Transactional annotation: &#x0040;Transactional(isolation=Isolation.READ_COMMITTED, propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED, rollbackFor=MyRollbackException.class) Spring's exception-handling model is different from SmartClient's, so care must be taken to get the correct error processing. If a transactional DSRequest fails, SmartClient code will throw an ordinary checked Exception; but Spring will ignore that Exception. So you can either: Wrap every DSRequest.execute() in a try/catch block. Catch Exception and throw a RuntimeException instead Just use the "rollbackFor" annotation to make your transactional method rollback for all instances of Exception Note: Spring transaction integration is conceptually different from SmartClient's DataSource.autoJoinTransactions','built-in transaction feature, because SmartClient transactions apply to a queue of DSRequests, whereas Spring transactions are scoped to a single method invocation. If you want to make a whole SmartClient queue share a single Spring-managed transaction, you can wrap the processing of an entire queue in a call to a transactional Spring method. See the <em>Using Spring Transactions with SmartClient DMI</em> section at the bottom of the springIntegration','Spring integration page for more details. You can set useSpringTransaction as the default setting for all dataSources for a given database provider by adding the property {dbName}.useSpringTransaction to your server.properties file. For example, Mysql.useSpringTransaction: true or hibernate.useSpringTransaction: true. You can set it as the default for all providers with a server.properties setting like this: useSpringTransaction: true. When useSpringTransaction is the default, you can switch it off for a specific dataSource by explicitly setting the flag to false for that DataSource. Finally, this setting can be overridden at the operationBinding level - see OperationBinding.useSpringTransaction <h3>Configuration</h3> When using Spring transactions, SmartClient needs a way to lookup the JNDI connection being used by Spring, and this needs to be configured. First, register a bean like this in your applicationContext.xml file: &lt;bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean"&gt; &lt;!-- Set this to the JNDI name Spring is using --&gt; &lt;property name="jndiName" value="isomorphic/jdbc/defaultDatabase"/&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; and then add a line like this to your server.properties: # Set this property to match the "id" of the JndiObjectFactoryBean registered in Spring sql.spring.jdbcDataSourceBean: dataSource

We recommend using this flag with care. NOTE: This setting can be overridden per-operation - see OperationBinding.useSubselectForRowCount.

NOTE: do not attempt to override this method to create a custom DataSource. For a server-side custom DataSource, use the DataSource.serverConstructor attribute, and the customDataSource', 'Custom DataSource samples. For a client-side custom DataSource, see DataSource.dataProtocol','dataProtocol:"custom". In contrast to ListGrid.fetchData, which creates a ResultSet to manage the returned data, calling dataSource.fetchData() provides the returned data in the callback as a simple JavaScript Array of JavaScript Objects. Calling dataSource.fetchData() does not automatically update any visual components or caches: code in the callback passed to fetchData() decides what to do with the returned data. For example, given a ListGrid "myGrid" and a DataSource "employees", the following code would populate "myGrid" with data fetched from the DataSource: isc.DataSource.get("employees").fetchData(null, "myGrid.setData(data)"); Unlike calling myGrid.fetchData(), which creates a ResultSet, the data provided to the grid is "disconnected" data, unmanaged by SmartClient's databinding facilities and safe to directly modify. This is useful when, for example, a ListGrid is being used as a more sophisticated version of HTML's multi-select component. Disconnected datasets may be used to populate various visual components. For example, while an individual FormItem can be configured to fetch FormItem.valueMap','valueMap options from a DataSource via the FormItem.optionDataSource','optionDataSource property, the following code shows storing a dataset to derive valueMaps from later: isc.DataSource.get("countries").fetchData(null, "window.countries = data"); ... later, a form is created dynamically ... function showForm() { isc.DynamicForm.create({ items : [ { name:"country", title:"Pick Country", valueMap: window.countries.getValueMap("countryId", "countryName") }, ... You can also create a ResultSet from the data retrieved from fetchData(), like so: isc.DataSource.get("countries").fetchData(null, function (dsResponse, data) { isc.ResultSet.create({ dataSource:"countries", allRows:data }) } ) This gives you a dataset that supports client-side filtering (via ResultSet.setCriteria','setCriteria()), can provide ResultSet.getValueMap','filtered valueMaps, will ResultSet.disableCacheSync','automatically reflect updates to the DataSource made via other components, and can be re-used with multiple visual components. See also DataSource.getClientOnlyDataSource and DataSource.cacheAllData for similar capabilities for dealing with smaller datasets entirely within the browser, or working with modifiable caches representing subsets of the data available from a DataSource. See also the server-side com.isomorphic.js.JSTranslater class in the ${isc.DocUtils.linkForDocNode('javaServerReference', 'Java Server Reference')} for other, similar approaches involving dumping data into the page during initial page load. Note: care should be taken when using this approach. Large datasets degrade the basic performance of some browsers, so use PickList.optionDataSource','optionDataSource and similar facilities to manage datasets that may become very large. Data-Driven Visual Component Creation DataSource.fetchData() can also be used to create SmartClient components in a data-driven way. Many properties on SmartClient visual components are configured via an Array of Objects - the same data format that dataSource.fetchData() returns. These include ListGrid.fields, TabSet.tabs, DynamicForm.items, Facet.values and even DataSource.fields. For example, if you had a DataSource "myFormFields" whose fields included the basic properties of FormItem','FormItems (name, title, type, etc), this example code would create a form based on stored field definitions, loaded from the "myFormFields" DataSource on the fly: isc.DataSource.get("myFormFields").fetchData(null, "isc.DynamicForm.create({ items:data })" ) This capability to dynamically create visual components from dynamically fetched data provides a foundation for creating interfaces that can be customized by end users. See also the server-side API com.isomorphic.datasource.DataSource.addDynamicDSGenerator() for dynamically creating DataSources supporting all server-side DataSource features, and DataSource.inheritsFrom for sharing field definitions across multiple DataSources.

NOTE: this feature applies to Enterprise Edition only; for more information on edition-specific features, see <a href='http://smartclient.com/product' target='_blank'>http://smartclient.com/product</a>. When auditing is enabled, every time a DSRequest modifies this DataSource, a Record is added to the audit DataSource that shows the record as it existed after the change was made (or for a "remove", the values of the record at the time of deletion). In addition, the audit DataSource has the following additional metadata fields: DataSource.auditTypeFieldName','"audit_operationType": type of the change ("update", "add" or "remove") DataSource.auditUserFieldName','"audit_modifier": username of the user that made the change. The username is determined in the same way that the OperationBinding.requiresRole','Declarative Security subsystem determines the current user. DataSource.auditTimeStampFieldName','"audit_changeTime": a field of type "datetime" recording the timestamp of the change DataSource.auditRevisionFieldName','"audit_revision": a field of type "sequence" recording a simple increasing integer value If any of the field names above collide with field names of the DataSource being audited, an integer suffix will also be added, starting with 2 (for example, "audit_modifier2", then "audit_modifier3", etc). To omit a data field from the automatically generated audit DataSource, just set DataSourceField.audit to false. Note: audit DataSource feature works only with single row operations, i.e. operations with OperationBinding.allowMultiUpdate','allowMultiUpdate enabled are not supported. Note, audit can be disabled for a given DSRequest via server-side API DSRequest.setSkipAudit() or for specific opreation via OperationBinding.skipAudit','operationBinding.skipAudit setting. <h4>Auto-generated Audit DataSources</h4> The audit DataSource is normally automatically generated, and unless otherwise specified with DataSource.auditDataSourceID, the ID of the audit DataSource will be audit_[OriginalDSID]. By default, the automatically generated audit DataSource will be of the same type as the DataSource being audited, however, if the DataSource being audited is not already a SQLDataSource, we recommend using DataSource.auditDSConstructor','auditDSConstructor:"sql" to use a SQLDataSource as the audit DataSource. This is because a SQLDataSource used an audit DataSource will automatically generate a SQL table for storing audit data the first time changes are made. JPA would require manual creation of a Java Bean, and Hibernate requires <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=hbm2ddl.auto' target='_blank'>hbm2ddl.auto=update</a> to be set, which is widely considered unsafe for production use. Automatically created audit DataSources can be loaded and queried just like other DataSources, using the DataSourceLoader, and using the server-side API DataSource.getAuditDataSource(). However, you must load the DataSource being audited before loading its automatically created audit DataSource. Note, that automatic SQL tables creation can be disabled. See DataSource.autoCreateAuditTable','autoCreateAuditTable for details. <h4>Manually created Audit DataSources</h4> The audit DataSource can also be manually created. In this case, you can can either follow the naming conventions described above for the ID of the audit DataSource and the names of metadata fields, or use the linked properties to assign custom names. If you omit any data fields from the tracked DataSource in your audit DataSource, those fields will be ignored for auditing purposes, exactly as though DataSourceField.audit had been set to false for an automatically-generated audit DataSource. Also, note that in case of manually defined audit DataSource, if this DataSource is defined so it inherits the audited DataSource, all the audited DataSource's fields will be inherited, this including the primary keys. Since for the audit DataSource the primary key should be the revision field, in order to prevent the audit DataSource having two primary keys, the inherited DataSource's primary key will have to be declared in audit DataSource, but with the primaryKey attribute omitted (as well not being of type "sequence") in the audit DataSource.

Note annotated classes are necessary for JPA DataSources, but you can choose to use them for other types of DataSource as well. For Hibernate DataSources, this is very worthwhile because Hibernate will also make use of the annotations as config, meaning you don't need to specify .hbm.xml files. For SQL and custom DataSources, there is no benefit at the persistence level, but it may still be worthwhile because the use of an annotated class gives us better metadata and allows us to generate a better, closer-fitting autoDerive DataSource than we can from examination of SQL schema or plain Java Beans: <table border="1" class="normal"> <tr><th>Java type</th><th>DataSourceField.type','DataSource type</th></tr> <tr><td>boolean, Boolean</td><td>boolean</td></tr> <tr><td>char, Character, String, Reader</td><td>text</td></tr> <tr><td>byte, short, int, long, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, BigInteger</td><td>integer</td></tr> <tr><td>float, double, Float, Double, BigDecimal</td><td>float</td></tr> <tr><td>InputStream</td><td>binary</td></tr> <tr><td>java.util.Date (with Temporal set to DATE), java.sql.Date</td><td>date</td></tr> <tr><td>java.util.Date (with Temporal set to TIME), java.sql.Time</td><td>time</td></tr> <tr><td>java.util.Date (with Temporal set to TIMESTAMP), java.util.Calendar, java.sql.Timestamp</td><td>datetime</td></tr> <tr><td>Enum (with Enumerated set to STRING)</td><td>enum (see discussion below)</td></tr> <tr><td>Enum (with Enumerated set to ORDINAL)</td><td>intEnum (see discussion below)</td></tr> <tr><td>Field with Lob annotation</td><td>binary</td></tr> <tr><td>Field with GeneratedValue annotation</td><td>sequence, if the field is an integer type (see discussion below)</td></tr> </table> <h4>Primary keys, sequences and identity columns</h4> We attempt to derive information about primary keys from the metadata we have. If the metadata source is an SQL table: If the table does not have a native primary key constraint, no attempt is made to identify primary key fields. Otherwise: The column or columns that make up the table's native primary key constraint are identified using the JDBC DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() API Each DataSource field that corresponds to one of these native primary key columns is marked primaryKey: true For each of these columns, the metadata returned by DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() is inspected. If the metadata includes IS_AUTOINCREMENT=YES, we mark the corresponding field as type="sequence". This information should be reliably provided by databases that implement "auto-increment" or "identity" column types, such as MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server If the previous step does not identify a column as a sequence, we inspect the ResultSetMetaData obtained by running a dummy query on the table. If the isAutoIncrement() API returns true for that column, we mark the corresponding field as type="sequence" If the previous steps have not identified the column as a sequence, we check the TYPE_NAME in the column metadata. If it is "serial", this means the column is a PostgreSQL "serial" or "serial8" type column. Postgres does not transparently implement auto-increment columns, but it does provide this serial type, which causes the column to be implicitly bound to an underlying sequence. So this type causes us to mark the field type="sequence", and we also set DataSourceField.implicitSequence','implicitSequence true If the previous steps have not identified the column as a sequence, we check the COLUMN_DEF in the column metadata. If this contains the token "$$ISEQ" and ends with "NEXTVAL", this means the column is an Oracle "GENERATED AS IDENTITY" column. This type of column was introduced in Oracle 12c and is conceptually exactly the same thing as the Postgres "serial" column described above. We treat it the same way: mark it type="sequence" and implicitSequence="true" If the previous steps have not identified the column as a sequence, then you may be using a pure sequence database, such as an Oracle version earlier than 12c, or you may be using a database where both sequences and identity columns are available (Oracle, Postgres, DB2), and a sequence is being used either by design or because the table was created before the database product supported identity columns. In this case, we cannot determine if the column should be a sequence or not. However, in many applications, the fact that the column is an integer and is a primary key would imply that it is also a sequence. Therefore, if the column is an integer and the server.properties flag auto.derive.integer.pk.always.sequence is true, we mark the field as type="sequence" If, after all this, SmartClient ends up incorrectly marking a primary key field as a sequence (or vice versa), you can always override it on a per-field basis by simply redeclaring the field with the correct type in your .ds.xml file: &lt;DataSource serverType="sql" tableName="myTable" autoDeriveSchema="true"&gt; &lt;fields&gt; &lt;!-- This field was incorrectly marked as a sequence --&gt; &lt;field name="notASeq" type="integer" /&gt; &lt;!-- This field was incorrectly marked as an integer when it should be a sequence --&gt; &lt;field name="isASeq" type="sequence" /&gt; &lt;/fields&gt; &lt;/DataSource&gt; If the metadata source is Hibernate mappings described in a .hbm.xml file: The first field we encounter that is described in the mapping with an &lt;id&gt; tag is marked as a primaryKey If that field is marked as being generated, we set its type to "sequence" If the metadata source is an annotated object (whether JPA, Hibernate or just an annotated POJO): Any field with an @Id annotation is is marked as a primaryKey (this differs from the Hibernate .hbm.xml file case because that is specific to Hibernate, which does support composite keys, but not by specifying multiple &lt;id&gt; tags. Annotations are supported, via annotated POJOs, for any kind of persistence strategy, so multiple @Id fields are perfectly valid) Any field with a @GeneratedValue annotation is either marked as type="sequence" (if it is an integer type) or as DataSourceField.autoGenerated','autoGenerated="true" (for other field types) Finally, if the metadata is a plain, unannotated Java object, no attempt is made to derive primary key fields. <h4>enums and valueMaps</h4> When we come across Java Enum properties in plain or annotated classes, as well as setting the field type as noted in the above tables, we also generate a valueMap for the field, based on the Enum members. For cases where we generate a field of SmartClient type "enum" (see the above tables), the keys of the valueMap are the result of calling name() on each member of the underlying Java Enum (in other words, its value exactly as declared in its enum declaration). For cases where we generate a field of SmartClient type "intEnum", the keys of the valueMap are strings representing the ordinal number of each member in the Java Enum - "0", "1", etc. Note that this behavior will be overriden by DataSource.enumTranslateStrategy','DataSource.enumTranslateStrategy if both are set. In both of these case, the display values generated for the valueMap are the result of calling toString() on each Enum member. If that gives the same value as calling name(), the value is passed through DataTools.deriveTitleFromName(), which applies the same processing rules as DataSource.getAutoTitle to derive a more user-friendly display value. <h4>Further notes</h4> schemaBean implies autoDeriveSchema, because it has no other purpose than to name the bean to use for auto-derived schema. Thus, if you specify schemaBean you do not need to specify autoDeriveSchema as well (though it does no harm to do so). However, tableName and beanClassName can be validly specified without implying autoDeriveSchema, so in those cases you must explicitly specify autoDeriveSchema. The underlying super-DataSource is cached in server memory, so that it does not have to be derived and created each time you need it. However, the cache manager will automatically refresh the cached copy if it detects that the deriving DataSource has changed. Thus, if you change the metadata your DataSource is deriving (if, for example, you add a column to a table), all you need to do is touch the .ds.xml file (ie, update its last changed timestamp - you don't actually have to change it) and the cached copy will be refreshed next time it is needed. When autoDeriveSchema is set, SQLDataSource will automatically discover foreignKeys and deliver table and column name information to the client in hashed form so that two DataSources that are linked by native SQL foreign keys will automatically discover each other if loaded into the same application, and set DataSourceField.foreignKey','foreignKey automatically. Because the table and column names are delivered as cryptohashes, there is no information leakage, but regardless, the feature can be disabled via setting datasource.autoLinkFKs to false in server_properties','server.properties. This hashed linkage information is delivered to the client in properties DataSource.tableCode and DataSourceField.fkTableCode/DataSourceField.fkColumnCode','fkColumnCode

Note that this includes fetch operations - setting this property to true has the same effect as a transaction policy of ALL for just this DataSource's operations - see the server-side RPCManager.setTransactionPolicy() for details of the different TransactionPolicy settings. If this property is explicitly false, this causes all operations on this DataSource to be committed individually - the same as a transaction policy of NONE, just for this DataSource's operations. In either case, you can override the setting for individual operations - see OperationBinding.autoJoinTransactions. If this property if null or not defined, we fall back to the default setting for this type of DataSource. These are defined in server_properties','server.properties as follows: Hibernate: hibernate.autoJoinTransactions JPA/JPA2: jpa.autoJoinTransactions SQL: There is one setting per configured database connection (DataSource.dbName','dbName). For example, the setting for the default MySQL connection is sql.Mysql.autoJoinTransactions If the setting is not defined at the DataSource-type level, we use the system global default, which is defined in server.properties as autoJoinTransactions. At the dbName and global system levels, you can set the autoJoinTransactions attribute to a valid Transaction Policy, rather than a simple true or false (although these values work too - true is the same as ALL, false is the same as NONE). For valid TransactionPolicy values and their meanings, see the server-side Javadoc for RPCManager.setTransactionPolicy() Note that the configuration settings discussed here can be overridden for a particular queue of requests by setting the server-side RPCManager's transaction policy. Look in the server-side Javadoc for RPCManager.getTransactionPolicy(). Transactions can also be initiated manually, separate from the RPCManager/HttpServletRequest lifecycle, useful for both multi-threaded web applications, and standalone applications that don't use a servlet container - see standaloneDataSourceUsage. NOTE: Setting this property to true does not cause a transactional persistence mechanism to automatically appear - you have to ensure that your DataSource supports transactions. The SmartClient built-in SQL, Hibernate and JPA DataSources support transactions, but note that they do so at the provider level. This means that you can combine updates to, say, an Oracle database and a MySQL database in the same queue, but they will be committed in <em>two</em> transactions - one per database. The SmartClient server will commit or rollback these two transactions as if they were one, so a failure in some Oracle update would cause all the updates to both databases to be rolled back. However, this is not a true atomic transaction; it is possible for one transaction to be committed whilst the other is not - in the case of hardware failure, for example. NOTE: Not all the supported SQL databases are supported for transactions. Databases supported in this release are: DB2 HSQLDB Firebird Informix Microsoft SQL Server MySQL (you must use InnoDB tables; the default MyISAM storage engine does not support transactions) Oracle PostgreSQL

For example, notify a related BPEL process of changes to certain fields.</dd> </dl> By using beanClassName on a specific OperationBinding, you can: Use a bean to represent your data only when it matters; for example, avoid the overhead of using a bean for "fetch" operations, but do use a bean for "update" operations so that you can execute relevant business logic after the update completes. Skip the use of beans for complex reporting queries that produce results unrelated to your persistent object model. Set beanClassName to blank ("") on a specific operationBinding to override DataSource.beanClassName for that specific operation. For SQL joins that produce additional data fields, use a special, operation-specific bean that represents a join of multiple entities and contains business logic specific to that joined dataset Note that beanClassName affects what numeric field types will be used for inbound DSRequest data. For fields with numeric types, the DSRequest.data','record data in DSRequests will automatically be converted to the type of the target field, before the request is received in a DMI. For details, see dsRequestBeanTypes. Note that dmiOverview','DMI also has a built-in facility for populating a bean with the inbound DSRequest.data - just declare the bean as a method argument. For generic DataSources (DataSources with serverType "generic") visualBuilder','Visual Builder sets this property when it creates a generic DataSource using the Javabean Wizard. It has no built-in server-side effects. For Hibernate DataSources (DataSources with serverType "hibernate") The name of the Java bean or POJO class that is mapped in Hibernate. This will typically be the fully-qualified class name - eg com.foo.MyClass - but it may be the simple class name - just MyClass - or it may be some other value. It all depends on how your classes have been mapped in Hibernate. The declared Java bean will affect how its properties will be mapped to built-in numeric types, see hibernateIntegration','Hibernate Integration overview for details. Note: If you are intending to use Hibernate as a data-access layer only, you do not need to create Hibernate mappings or Java objects: SmartClient will generate everything it needs on the fly. For JPA DataSources (DataSources with serverType "jpa" or "jpa1") The fully qualified class name of the JPA annotated entity. NOTE for Hibernate and JPA users: When you use JPA, or use Hibernate as a full ORM system (ie, not just allowing SmartClient Server to drive Hibernate as a data access layer), the beans returned on the server-side are live. This means that if you make any changes to them, the ORM system will persist those changes. This is true even if the beans were created as part of a fetch operation. This causes a problem in the common case where you want to use a DMI or custom DataSource implementation to apply some post-processing to the beans fetched from the persistent store. If you change the values in the beans directly, those changes will be persisted. If you want to alter the data returned from a JPA or Hibernate persistent store as part of a fetch request just so you can alter what gets sent to the client, you can use the server-side DSResponse's getRecords() method. This will return your bean data in "record" format - ie, as a List of Maps. You can alter these records without affecting your persistent store, and then call setData() on the DSResponse), passing the altered list of records. See the server-side Javadocs for DSResponse for details of these two methods.

Note that listFiles does not recurse into subdirectories. If the same combination of fileName / fileType / fileFormat exists in more than one configured location, then the data for fileSize and fileLastModified will be taken from the last configured location which contains the file. <dt>DataSource.hasFile','hasFile <dd>Indicates whether the file exists in any of the configured locations. <dt>DataSource.getFile','getFile <dd>Returns file data by searching the locations in reverse order. <dt>DataSource.saveFile','saveFile <dd>If the file exists, it will be saved in the last location in which it exists.

Note that if the file exists in more than one location, the removal will not affect other locations.

If you do not provide this property, table names will not be qualified in generated SQL, and thus the default schema will be used. Support for multiple schemas (or schemata) varies quite significantly across the supported databases, as does the meaning of the phrase "default schema". In addition, some databases allow you to override the default schema in the JDBC connection URL, which is a preferable approach if all your tables are in the same (non-default) schema. The following table provides information by product: <table border="1" class="normal" width="90%"> <tr><td> Product</td><td width="90%"> Notes</td></tr> <tr><td> DB2</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. The default schema is named after the connecting user, though this can be overridden by specifying the "currentSchema" property on the JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> DB2 for iSeries</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. "Schema" is synonymous with "library". The default schema depends on the setting of the "naming" connection property. When this is set to "sql", behavior is similar to other DB2 editions: the default schema is named after the connecting user, unless overridden by specifying a library name in the JDBC connection URL. When "naming" is set to "system", the schema of an unqualified table is resolved using a traditional search of the library list; the library list can be provided in the "libraries" property</td></tr> <tr><td> Firebird</td><td> Firebird does not support the concept of schema at all - all "schema objects" like tables and indexes belong directly to the database. In addition, Firebird actively rejects qualified table names in queries as syntax errors; therefore, you should not set the schema property for a DataSource that will be backed by a Firebird database </td></tr> <tr><td> HSQLDB</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. The default schema is auto-created when the database is created; by default it is called "PUBLIC", but can be renamed. It is not possible to set the default schema in the JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> Informix</td><td> Informix databases can be flagged as "ANSI mode" at creation time. ANSI-mode databases behave similarly to DB2 for schema support: arbitrarily named schemas are supported, and the default schema is the one named after the connected user. Non-ANSI databases have no real schema support at all. It is not possible to set the default schema in the JDBC connection URL with either type of database</td></tr> <tr><td> Microsoft SQL Server</td><td> Prior to SQL Server 2005, schema support is similar to Oracle: "schema" is synonymous with "owner". As of SQL Server 2005, schema is supported as a separate concept, and a user's default schema can be configured (though it still defaults to a schema with the same name as the user). It is not possible to set the default schema in the JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> MySQL</td><td> MySQL does not have a separate concept of "schema"; it treats the terms "schema" and "database" interchangeably. In fact MySQL databases actually behave more like schemas, in that a connection to database X can refer to a table in database Y simply by qualifying the name in the query. Also, because schema and database are the same concept in MySQL, overriding the "default schema" is done implicitly when you specify which database to connect to in your JDBC connection URL</td></tr> <tr><td> Oracle</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are not supported; in Oracle, "schema" is synonymous with "user", so each valid user in the database is associated implicitly with a schema of the same name, and there are no other schemas possible. It is possible to refer to tables in another user's schema (assuming you have the privileges to do so) by simply qualifying the table name. The default schema is always implied by the connecting user and cannot be overridden.</td></tr> <tr><td> Postgres</td><td> Arbitrarily named schemas are supported. Rather than the concept of a "default schema", Postgres supports the idea of a search path of schemas, whereby unqualified table references cause a search of the list of schemas in order, and the first schema in the path is the "current" one for creation purposes. Unfortunately, there is no way to specify this search path on the JDBC connection URL, so the default schema comes from the user definition, ultimately defaulting to the default "public" schema</td></tr> </table>

This can be done in the @Transactional annotation: &#x0040;Transactional(isolation=Isolation.READ_COMMITTED, propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED, rollbackFor=MyRollbackException.class) Spring's exception-handling model is different from SmartClient's, so care must be taken to get the correct error processing. If a transactional DSRequest fails, SmartClient code will throw an ordinary checked Exception; but Spring will ignore that Exception. So you can either: Wrap every DSRequest.execute() in a try/catch block. Catch Exception and throw a RuntimeException instead Just use the "rollbackFor" annotation to make your transactional method rollback for all instances of Exception Note: Spring transaction integration is conceptually different from SmartClient's DataSource.autoJoinTransactions','built-in transaction feature, because SmartClient transactions apply to a queue of DSRequests, whereas Spring transactions are scoped to a single method invocation. If you want to make a whole SmartClient queue share a single Spring-managed transaction, you can wrap the processing of an entire queue in a call to a transactional Spring method. See the <em>Using Spring Transactions with SmartClient DMI</em> section at the bottom of the springIntegration','Spring integration page for more details.

For example, given a ListGrid "myGrid" and a DataSource "employees", the following code would populate "myGrid" with data fetched from the DataSource: isc.DataSource.get("employees").fetchData(null, "myGrid.setData(data)"); Unlike calling myGrid.fetchData(), which creates a ResultSet, the data provided to the grid is "disconnected" data, unmanaged by SmartClient's databinding facilities and safe to directly modify. This is useful when, for example, a ListGrid is being used as a more sophisticated version of HTML's multi-select component. Disconnected datasets may be used to populate various visual components. For example, while an individual FormItem can be configured to fetch FormItem.valueMap','valueMap options from a DataSource via the FormItem.optionDataSource','optionDataSource property, the following code shows storing a dataset to derive valueMaps from later: isc.DataSource.get("countries").fetchData(null, "window.countries = data"); ... later, a form is created dynamically ... function showForm() { isc.DynamicForm.create({ items : [ { name:"country", title:"Pick Country", valueMap: window.countries.getValueMap("countryId", "countryName") }, ... You can also create a ResultSet from the data retrieved from fetchData(), like so: isc.DataSource.get("countries").fetchData(null, function (dsResponse, data) { isc.ResultSet.create({ dataSource:"countries", allRows:data }) } ) This gives you a dataset that supports client-side filtering (via ResultSet.setCriteria','setCriteria()), can provide ResultSet.getValueMap','filtered valueMaps, will ResultSet.disableCacheSync','automatically reflect updates to the DataSource made via other components, and can be re-used with multiple visual components. See also DataSource.getClientOnlyDataSource and DataSource.cacheAllData for similar capabilities for dealing with smaller datasets entirely within the browser, or working with modifiable caches representing subsets of the data available from a DataSource. See also the server-side com.isomorphic.js.JSTranslater class in the ${isc.DocUtils.linkForDocNode('javaServerReference', 'Java Server Reference')} for other, similar approaches involving dumping data into the page during initial page load. Note: care should be taken when using this approach. Large datasets degrade the basic performance of some browsers, so use PickList.optionDataSource','optionDataSource and similar facilities to manage datasets that may become very large. Data-Driven Visual Component Creation DataSource.fetchData() can also be used to create SmartClient components in a data-driven way. Many properties on SmartClient visual components are configured via an Array of Objects - the same data format that dataSource.fetchData() returns. These include ListGrid.fields, TabSet.tabs, DynamicForm.items, Facet.values and even DataSource.fields. For example, if you had a DataSource "myFormFields" whose fields included the basic properties of FormItem','FormItems (name, title, type, etc), this example code would create a form based on stored field definitions, loaded from the "myFormFields" DataSource on the fly: isc.DataSource.get("myFormFields").fetchData(null, "isc.DynamicForm.create({ items:data })" ) This capability to dynamically create visual components from dynamically fetched data provides a foundation for creating interfaces that can be customized by end users. See also the server-side API com.isomorphic.datasource.DataSource.addDynamicDSGenerator() for dynamically creating DataSources supporting all server-side DataSource features, and DataSource.inheritsFrom for sharing field definitions across multiple DataSources.

		/** (Read only) This property indicates that this field should be represented by a custom expression embedded in the WHERE clause of the generated SQL, instead of the generated expression containing this field name that would ordinarily be used. You use this property when you have to accomodate some special way of using a field's value in criteria, other than by directly comparing it to the criteria. For example, if you have a column that contains bit-packed information you will generally need to perform a bitwise AND to filter on that column, rather than an equality check. In this case, you would use a customCriteriaExpression something like this (in Oracle): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BITAND(myField, $criteria.myField)+0 = $criteria.myField Or this (in MySQL or SQL Server): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myField & $criteria.myField = $criteria.myField As this example shows, a customCriteriaExpression is expected to be a complete logical expression that provides both sides of the comparison. After Velocity processing, this example would result in SQL similar to this (for the MySQL case); the colored part comes entirely from the customCriteriaExpression: SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE <font color='blue'>myField & 32 = 32</font> customCriteriaExpression can also be used with AdvancedCriteria. Note that the point mentioned above, about a customCriteriaExpression being a complete logical expression that provides both sides of the comparison still applies. This means that when you use customCriteriaExpression in conjunction with AdvancedCriteria, you effectively switch off support for different OperatorIds to be used on that field, unless you use Velocity expressions containing the special $criteriaOperator variable (see below). When you use customCriteriaExpression with AdvancedCriteria, the way you access criteria values differs slightly. One option is to use the $advancedCriteria Velocity variable, as described in the "Using AdvancedCriteria" section of the customQuerying','custom querying overview. However, this variable only returns the value from the first Criterion that uses the field, as found by depth-first search. If your AdvancedCriteria contains multiple references to this field, this will not be satisfactory. Therefore, specifically for customCriteriaExpression, we provide another Velocity variable, $criteriaValue. This variable means "the value on a Criterion referencing this field". An example may serve to clarify this: Assume you need to extend the above example to filter records where a certain bit is set OR a certain other bit is set. An AdvancedCriteria like this would be required (note that the choice of "equals" as the operator in these clauses is completely arbitrary - as discussed above, the operator is ignored when we have a customCriteriaExpression, so it would make no difference to the end product if we had used different operators here): { _constructor: "AdvancedCriteria", operator: "or", criteria: [ { fieldName: "myField", operator: "equals", value: 32 }, { fieldName: "myField", operator: "equals", value: 64 }, ] } If you used the customCriteriaExpression from above unchanged with this criteria, the following SQL would be generated (in the MySQL case): SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE myField & null = null OR myField & null = null This is because $criteria is a variable that only works correctly with simple criteria. If you changed the $criteria references in the expression to $advancedCriteria, the generated SQL would be: SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE myField & 32 = 32 OR myField & 32 = 32 This is because $advancedCriteria always returns the first value it finds for a particular field, as described above. However, if you change the expression so it reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myField & $criteriaValue = $criteriaValue you will now get the correct SQL generated: SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE myField & 32 = 32 OR myField & 64 = 64 Similar to $criteriaValue, we provide a special variable, $criteriaOperator. This is intended for use in Velocity expressions, so that your customCriteriaExpression can process different operators in different ways. How you choose to interpret an operator is entirely up to you; this variable is both advanced and rarely used. This example is contrived and does not show a usage that would be remotely likely in a real application, but it does show how to use the variable in a Velocity expression: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myField #if ($criteriaOperator == "greaterThan") & #else | #end $criteriaValue = $criteriaValue For simple criteria, note that $criteriaOperator will vary depending on field type and the TextMatchStyle','textMatchStyle in force, as follows: Text fields with textMatchStyle "substring" - "iContains" Text fields with textMatchStyle "startsWith" - "iStartsWith" Text fields with textMatchStyle "exact" - "iEquals" All other cases (including text fields with textMatchStyle "exactCase") - "equals" You can use Velocity expressions in your customCriteriaExpressions, and the velocitySupport','usual context variables are available. Note that the results of Velocity evaluations are automatically quoted and escaped by default; this behavior can be switched off - see DataSourceField.autoQuoteCustomExpressions','autoQuoteCustomExpressions, and particularly note the warnings about its use. Note that this property only applies to users of the SmartClient server using dataSources of type "sql".

		/** (Read only) This property is similar to DataSourceField.customUpdateExpression','customUpdateExpression; its value is used during "add" operations. If you do not specify this property, but do specify a customUpdateExpression, the customUpdateExpression is used instead. Everything that applies to customUpdateExpression also applies to this property, including the observation that fields which specify a DataSourceField.customSelectExpression','customSelectExpression but no corresponding customUpdateExpression or customInsertExpression, will be ignored when adding new records. As with customUpdateExpression, this property is only intended to be used when you have a need to customize the actual SQL. If you simply want to use a server-derived value in the query, you should use transactionChaining','Transaction Chaining, dmiOverview','DMI, or a serverScript','server script instead. <h3>customInsertExpression with primaryKey fields</h3> if you use customInsertExpression to derive a value for a DataSourceField.primaryKey','primaryKey field, the key value will not by default be available to the framework, so the built-in cache synchronization system will not work. It may be possible to to work around this with the DataSourceField.autoGenerated','autoGenerated flag, as described below, but otherwise you must also create a OperationBinding.cacheSyncOperation','cacheSyncOperation which can retrieve the record just added to the database. Please also see the documentation for SequenceMode','SequenceMode "none", which talks further about cacheSyncOperation. Typically, primaryKey fields that need to be auto-generated are implemented using a sequence field, which at the database level translates to either an actual sequence, or an auto-increment or "identity" column. JDBC drivers have special support for such columns, so we are able to determine the generated value. This is important for primaryKey fields because, without it, we cannot re-fetch the record just inserted for cache synchronization purposes, as described above. Where a value is generated by something other than a sequence field, this special ability is lost - or at least, it is no longer guaranteed to be present. There are use cases where this may seem to be a restriction. A common case would be where you wish to use a generated UUID as primaryKey value, rather than an ordinary ascending sequence. If you had intended to do this using the database itself - for example, specifying a customInsertExpression that calls something like MySQL's UUID() built-in function - this is potentially a problem. What we would recommend in this case and anything similar, is to use the general ability for field values to be generated by application code, as described above. (Note, if you want to have application code generate values for primaryKey fields, you may need to use an OperationBinding','operationBinding that specifies OperationBinding.providesMissingKeys','providesMissingKeys). That said, different database vendors implement their JDBC drivers in different ways, and with the SQLDataSource and certain database products it is possible to retrieve values that were generated at the database level by a customInsertExpression that expresses either a user-defined function call or an inline subselect, as long as the field is marked with the autoGenerated flag. Because this behavior is potentially useful, we do not inhibit it; however, we also do not recommend that you make use of it, because the behavior is not portable across databases, and may also not be portable across JDBC driver versions (because the behavior is unspecified and undocumented, and relies on implementation details that may change). Databases where this behavior has been observed to work include Oracle, Postgres and HSQLDB; databases where this behavior is known not to work include MySQL, SQL Server, DB2 and Firebird (the latter because its JDBC driver does not support the getGeneratedKeys() API) Note that this property only applies to users of the SmartClient server using dataSources of type "sql".

		/** An optional FormatString for this field, for use when DataBoundComponent.exportData','exporting data to spreadsheet formats (XLS and OOXML/XLSX), XML, JSON or CSV. You can use this property to override the normal DataSourceField.format','format of this field, if any, specifically for exports. Note, for server-driven exports you can specify default formats for date, time and datetime fields by specifying properties export.format.default.date, export.format.default.time and export.format.default.datetime in your server.properties file. These formats will be used for fields that do not have a "format" or "exportFormat" property specified in the .ds.xml file. Specifically when exporting to spreadsheet formats, the FormatString is translated to the type of format string used by spreadsheet programs like Excel. A handful of features are not present in Excel format strings, and some features behave slightly differently. These differences are explained below. <h3>Excel cannot handle dates prior to January 1st 1900</h3> This is a well-known limitation of Excel dates; it is not a formatting issue as such. <h3>Currency symbols become fixed to the current locale at export time</h3> The placeholder currency symbol "&#x00A4" (\u00A4) in a numeric format string is rendered as the NumberUtil.currencySymbol','localized currency symbol. When exporting, the format string provided to Excel contains the currency symbol for the current locale of the SmartClient application, and not a placeholder currency symbol that would make Excel pick up a currency symbol based on the operating system locale. We do this to ensure that the spreadsheet reflects the <em>application's</em> localization, rather than the localization of the current user's computer, because they may be different. <h3>Rounding differences</h3> The approach to rounding a positive number to a set number of decimal places is fairly universally agreed upon for non-specialized requirements: add 0.5 (or 0.05, or 0.005, or whatever) to the number and then truncate. This leads to the well understood convention that numbers exactly halfway between two possible rounding outcomes, go to the larger one. So 7.5 becomes 8 and 7.15 becomes 7.2. However, there is no such universal agreement when it come to rounding negative numbers. Some take the view that you should round by taking the number to the larger absolute value, so -7.15 becomes -7.2. Others feel that you should round by taking the number to the larger value in the sense of it being "less negative", so -7.15 becomes -7.1. SmartClient formatting takes the first approach and rounds negative numbers away from zero. We do this simply because that is what Java DecimalFormat does. Unfortunately, Excel does the opposite. Therefore, you will see rounding differences on negative numbers on exact 50% boundaries: SmartClient will format -7.15 as -7.2, while Excel will format the same value as -7.1. <h3>Different treatment of '#'</h3> Both SmartClient and Excel use '#' to mean "digit, do not show zeroes". However, Excel does not implement this strictly in the integer part when the number it is formatting has a value of 0 in the integer part. So, with a format of "#.##", the value 0.25 is formatted as "0.25". SmartClient (like Java DecimalFormat) is strict: with that format, 0.25 is formatted as ".25"; if you want to match Excel's output, you must use the format "0.##". <h3>Miscellaneous edge cases</h3> There is quite a lot of variation in behavior between Java DecimalFormat and Excel around the edges. For actual error cases - for example, a format string that just contains nonsense - it is normal and expected that the SmartClient behavior and the Excel behavior do not match - this is just two systems producing different garbage out for the same garbage in, which is to be expected. For valid but weird usages - for example, a format with multiple percent signs - SmartClient's formatting is in line with what DecimalFormat does, unless DecimalFormat throws an Exception, in which case we just do the thing that seems most sensible, or the thing that was easiest to implement. Known differences in behavior in edge cases include: SmartClient ignores formatting characters in the number part of the format string, whereas Excel rejects the format (this behavior may vary with different releases of Excel and supposedly compatible libraries: POI, for example, will accept such format strings). If you attempt to format 5.175 with the format string "#b0.#a#", SmartClient will return "5.72", and Excel will reject the format SmartClient ignores quoted characters in the number part of the format string, whereas Excel preserves them. If you attempt to format 5.175 with the format string "#'b'0.#'a'#", SmartClient will return "5.72", and Excel will return "b5.7a2" If you specify the empty string as a format string, SmartClient returns the result of calling toString() on the number; Excel uses the built-in "General" format. These two approaches will generally give the same or very similar results, but that is really a coincidence: the correct way to obtain matching results in the browser and the spreadsheet is to specify a valid format string If you specify a format string that contains no number part (ie, no '#' or '0' characters), SmartClient does what DecimalFormat does, which is to output the integer part of the number alongside the fixed part of the format. Excel just outputs the fixed part. So, if you attempt to format -5.3 with the format string "'Hello world'", SmartClient will output "-Hello world5", whereas Excel will output just "Hello world" If you specify multiple percent signs in the format, SmartClient treats all but the first one as static text, so 0.5 formatted with "#%%%" is "50%%%" (ie, all the signs are preserved but there is only one multiplcation by 100). Excel multiplies for each percent sign, so 0.5 formatted with "#%%%" is "500000%%%" <h3>Date format functionality not supported by Excel</h3> The following date/time/datetime functionality is not supported by Excel; if you use formatters that use any of this functionality, your values will be exported to Excel incorrectly formatted. In cases like this, we recommend that you use a separate exportFormat, with the intent of exporting your values in a way that is similar to your application formatting (which would be specified with the DataSourceField.format','format property), but within the confines of what Excel supports. Fiscal year, week and day (LL, LLLL, C, CC, c, cc) Week in year (w, ww) Day in year (D, DD) Day number in week (u) Explicit control over whether to use 12- or 24-hour notation. In Excel, this is implied by the presence or absence of the AM/PM designator If the user's operating system locale is different to the locale in use in the SmartClient application, day and month names may be different in the spreadsheet <h3>Number format functionality not supported by Excel</h3> The only SmartClient number-formatting functionality not supported for export to Excel is "multiply by 1000 and show as per mille". <h3>Limit on number of custom Excel formats</h3> Excel limits the number of custom format strings in a single spreadsheet to somewhere between 200 and 250, depending on your locale and language. Hitting this limit in an export would require hundreds of field definitions, each defining unique FormatStrings. If you do hit the limit, the only workaround is to use fewer unique FormatStrings.

It also means that SmartClient does not attempt to retrieve the field value from an actual database sequence, instead relying on the JDBC driver to return the generated value (see the note on sequenceMode below). Implicitly bound columns are a syntactic convenience provided by some databases to simulate the "auto-increment" or "identity" columns available natively in other products, without the underlying sequence having to be explicitly referenced in SQL queries. Currently, these database products support this idea: PostgreSQL has had a "serial" column type for a long time - <a href=http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL> http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL</a> DB2 has long supported a "GENERATED AS IDENTITY" notation for numeric fields. This may or may not be implemented with a sequence - the documentation does not specify - but we support it via the implicitSequence mechanism because it is so similar to the implicit sequence approach in Oracle. <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2z10.doc.apsg/src/tpc/db2z_identitycols.htm"> http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2z10.doc.apsg/src/tpc/db2z_identitycols.htm</a> Oracle introduced a "GENERATED AS IDENTITY" notation for numeric fields in version 12c - <a href=http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1.php> http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1.php</a> If you have columns like these in your database, declare them as type "sequence" and mark them with the implicitSequence flag. NOTE: If you use this property, you should also set the DataSource.sequenceMode','DataSource sequenceMode to "jdbcDriver". This is necessary because SmartClient cannot directly query the implicit sequence that is being used behind the scenes, so we must rely on the JDBC driver to do that. If you use DataSource.autoDeriveSchema','autoDeriveSchema to automatically derive a dataSource from table metadata, SmartClient attempts to identify these special Oracle and Postgres columns by heuristic examination of the metadata. When it identifies such a column, it marks the corresponding dataSourceField implicitSequence: true, and changes the sequenceMode on the DataSource to "jdbcDriver". If your table contains one of these columns and SmartClient does not automatically identify it, bear in mind that you can always set this flag manually, even if you are using autoDeriveSchema. This setting has no effect for non-SQL dataSources, or for databases other than those mentioned above.

For including from a related DataSource where there are multiple related records, see DataSourceField.includeSummaryFunction','includeSummaryFunction. DataSourceField.name will default to the name of the included field, or you can specify a different name. If both DataSources are SQLDataSources, HibernateDataSources or JPADataSources (with Hibernate as the provider) the related data will be retrieved via a SQL join and criteria and sort directions applied to the field work normally (they become part of the generated SQL query). Otherwise, the related data will be retrieved via performing a DSRequest against the related DataSource once the data from the primary DataSource has been retrieved. In this case, criteria or sorting directions applied to the included field are only allowed if data paging is not in use (for example ListGrid.dataFetchMode:"basic"); otherwise, criteria and sort direction are ignored for the included field and a warning is logged on the server. Editing included fields An included field is DataSourceField.canEdit','canEdit:false by default. Note that included fields are not updatable, even if you set canEdit:true; the server will simply drop values for included fields if client code sends them. When thinking about editing an included field value, typically what is really intended is to edit the value of the foreignKey field. For example, take the scenario of a system that tracks accounts and the employees assigned to manage them. Given a DataSource "account" related one-to-one with DataSource "employee" by a "managerId" foreignKey field, we might declare an includeFrom so that the name of the account manager can be shown with each "account" record. Editing the manager's name while viewing the account would be intended to pick a new account manager, and not to change the legal name of the employee who happens to be the current account manager. To correctly set up this scenario, declare an includeFrom field that is hidden, but is used as the DataSourceField.displayField','displayField for the foreign key field. Setting useLocalDisplayFieldValue to true will ensure the display field value is picked up from the record currently being edited: &lt;field name="managerId" foreignKey="employee.id" displayField="managerName" useLocalDisplayFieldValue="true"/&gt; &lt;field name="managerName" includeFrom="employee.name" hidden="true"/&gt; Now: the "managerId" foreignKey field is shown in grids and forms, but takes its displayed value from the hidden includeFrom field. the automatically chosen editor will be a SelectItem with SelectItem.optionDataSource','optionDataSource set to "employees": it will allow picking a different "employee" record from the "employee" DataSource saving will save the ID of a new "employee" record to the "managerId" foreign key field, as intended You can alternatively set editorType="ComboBoxItem" on the "managerId" field to allow typeahead search of the "employee" DataSource. Note that the DataSourceField.foreignDisplayField attribute allows developers to have a different fieldName be used locally as a displayField from the field name for the display field in the foreign dataSource.

		/** (Read only) For a field that uses DataSourceField.includeFrom, specifies which DataSourceField.foreignKey','foreignKey field should be used to find records in the related DataSource. includeVia only needs to be set when you have more than one foreignKey to the same related DataSource. If you have multiple foreignKeys to multiple different DataSources, there is no need to set includeVia. For example, perhaps you have a DataSource "moneyTransfer" where each record represents a money transfer, where the source and payment currencies are different, and the list of currencies is stored in a related DataSource "currency". Each "moneyTransfer" record is linked to 2 "currency" records, through two different foreignKey fields, "sourceCurrencyId" and "paymentCurrencyId". The following declarations would be required to use includeFrom to get a include the field "currencySymbol" from each of the two related "currency" records. &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="sourceCurrencyId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="paymentCurrencyId"/&gt; <h3>SQL Templating and includeVia</h3> The includeVia feature uses SQL table aliases in the generated SQL when generating multiple SQL joins to the same SQL table. When using customQuerying','SQL Templating, it's sometimes necessary to know the names of the aliases in the generated SQL. The table alias used can be configured via setting DataSourceField.relatedTableAlias on the foreignKey field, for example, using the declarations below, aliases "source" and "payment" would be used for the two "currency" tables. &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="source"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="payment"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="sourceCurrencyId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="paymentCurrencyId"/&gt; <h3>Multiple indirection and relatedTableAlias</h3> Sometimes you may have two includeFrom fields that include a field which is itself included from another DataSource, for example: &lt;field name="sourceCurId" nativeName="sourceCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="source"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.groupName" includeVia="sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurId" nativeName="paymentCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="payment"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="paymentCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.groupName" includeVia="paymentCurId"/&gt; .. where the "currency" DataSource used above is related to the "currencyGroup" DataSource via fields: &lt;field name="groupId" type="integer" foreignKey="currencyGroup.id" relatedTableAlias="group"/&gt; &lt;field name="groupName" type="text" includeFrom="currencyGroup.groupName"/&gt; Fields "sourceCurrencyGroup" and "paymentCurrencyGroup" include a field that is itself an included field. In this case "currencyGroup" table will be referenced two times, and its relatedTableAlias defined in "currency" DataSource will be prefixed with the includeVia value to make aliases unique in generated SQL: "sourceCurId_group" and "paymentCurId_group". The same aliases would be used if "sourceCurrencyGroup" and "paymentCurrencyGroup" fields were to include "currencyGroup.groupName" indirectly: &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="paymentCurId"/&gt; This works the same for more complex relationships. If we add a "moneyTransferDetail" DataSource to the sample above which has multiple references to "moneyTransfer" DataSource and would include fields from "currency" and "currencyGroup" DataSources: &lt;field name="mtId" nativeName="moneyTransferId" type="integer" foreignKey="moneyTransfer.id" relatedTableAlias="main" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainTransferName" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.name" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainSourceSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainSourceGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainPaymentSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainPaymentGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mtPrevId" nativeName="moneyTransferPreviousId" type="integer" foreignKey="moneyTransfer.id" relatedTableAlias="prev" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousTransferName" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.name" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousSourceSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousSourceGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousPaymentSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousPaymentGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; In this scenario the "currencyGroup" table will be joined 4 times - for all main/prev transfer and payment/source currency combinations. So, aliases will be prefixed with both intermediate includeVia values: "mtId_sourceCurId_group", "mtId_paymentCurId_group", "mtPrevId_sourceCurId_group", "mtPrevId_paymentCurId_group". It is also allowed to specify a series of FK fields in includeVia, for example "moneyTransferDetail" could declare: &lt;field name="mainSourceCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="mtId.sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="mainPaymentCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="mtId.paymentCurId"/&gt; In this case the prefix used for table aliases will be the includeVia value with "_" substituted for ".", so the table aliases will be "mtId_sourceCurId_group" and "mtId_paymentCurId_group". Note that if DataSourceField.relatedTableAlias','related table alias is not specified, then we don't make any guarantees what alias will be generated. Note that Oracle has a limit of 30 characters on identifier names. We limit table aliases to 30 characters all databases despite actual database in use to support portability across databases. If the generated table alias would exceed 30 chars, we instead use a generated and unpredictable value like "a123". To avoid hitting this limit for the advanced cases discussed above: use relatively short strings for relatedTableAlias for rare, multi-step inclusion scenarios where multiple field names are used as a prefix, if field names are very long in order to match database column names, you can use a shorter field name and use DataSourceField.nativeName to specify the underlying column name (this is demonstrated in samples above - note field "mtPrevId")

JPA and Hibernate DataSources use multiple:true as part of the declaration of One-To-Many and Many-to-Many relations - see jpaHibernateRelations for details. <h4>Criteria on multiple:true fields: client-side filtering</h4> For simple Criteria, the criteria value is compared to each field value in the multiple:true field, according to the DSRequest.textMatchStyle','textMatchStyle. If any field value matches the filter value, the field is considered to match the criteria. For AdvancedCriteria, for normal OperatorId','search operators the field value is considered as matching the Criterion if any of the field values match the Criterion. Specifically, this is true of all operators that have an OperatorValueType','operatorValueType of "fieldType" or "valueRange". For operators that compare against other fields in same record, such as "equalsField", if the other field is not multiple:true, matching works the same as for normal operators, that is, as if criterion.value directly contained the value rather than the name of another field. If the other field is also multiple:true, only "equalsField", "notEqualsField", "iEqualsField" and "iNotEqualsField" are allowed (any other operator will cause a warning and be ignored) and the set of values in the field must be identical (aside from case, for operators prefixed with "i") and in identical order to match. For the inSet operator, the field matches if there is any intersection between the field values and the array of values provided in criterion.value. notInSet is the reverse. Finally, for "isBlank", "notBlank", "isNull" and "notNull", an empty Array is considered non-null. For example, if you use dataFormat:"json" and the field value is provided to the browser as [] (JSON for an empty Array), the field is considered non-null. <h4>Server-side Representation and Storage</h4> Values for multiple:true fields appear as Java Lists when received in server code such as a DMI. The SmartClient Server supports simple storage of values that are multiple:true, controlled via the DataSourceField.multipleStorage setting. For server-side behavior of JPA and Hibernate relation fields that are multiple:true, see jpaHibernateRelations. For non-relation fields, the SmartClient Server supports simple storage of values that are multiple:true, controlled via the DataSourceField.multipleStorage setting, with some limited support for server-side filtering, as described in the DataSourceField.multipleStorage docs. For the built-in SQL, Hibernate and JPA connectors, if criteria are specified for a multiple:true field where multipleStorage is null or "none", the SmartClient server knows nothing about how the multiple values are stored, so as a fallback the criteria will operate as though the field were a normal, non-multiple "text" field. This will generally not match the client-side filtering behavior described above, so filtering should either be performed entirely on the client (for example, via ListGrid.dataFetchMode','dataFetchMode:"local" or entirely on the server (via ResultSet.useClientFiltering:"false") The server-side filtering is done through a criteria transform which happens with DataSource.transformMultipleFields','transformMultipleFields. <h4>XML Serialization</h4> Specifically for XML serialization and deserialization, multiple:true behaves similarly to the <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=soap+array' target='_blank'>SOAP array idiom</a>, that is, there will be a "wrapper element" named after the field name, whose contents will be several elements of the specified DataSourceField.type','field.type. For example, Layout.members is declared with type:"Canvas", multiple:true. The correct XML format is thus: &lt;VLayout&gt; &lt;members&gt; &lt;Canvas ID="myCanvas" ... /&gt; &lt;ListGrid ID="myGrid" .../&gt; &lt;Toolstrip ID="myToolStrip" ... /&gt; &lt;/members&gt; &lt;/VLayout&gt; See DataSourceField.childTagName for customizing the tagName used for subelements.

		/** (Read only) How values for a DataSourceField.multiple','multiple:true field should be stored. On the server, field values for multiple:true fields are represented as Java Lists in DSRequest and DSResponse objects, but when multipleStorage is used, are ultimately stored as Strings. This storage mechanism is "denormalized" in the sense of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization' target='_blank'>database normalization</a> because the field contains a compound value rather than an atomic value. Specifically, this makes the field harder to use with database features like SQL joins, since its value cannot be directly compared to other, singular fields. For this reason, there's really only a narrow set of cases where it makes sense to use this storage mechanism, consider it if: the values don't appear in any other tables or columns elsewhere in your database (so joins and other comparisons wouldn't be possible anyway) there is no authoritative list of all possible values, or even of popular values; it's basically freeform, like arbitrary, uncurated "tags" applied to photos or links A multiple:true field can be of any SimpleType, including "date", "time", "datetime", "float", "int" etc. Type will be preserved across a store and reload cycle, so for example a List of values for a field of type "int" will arrive at the server in a DSRequest as a List of Integer, be stored as a String, but appear again as a List of Integer inside a DSResponse. When storing "date", "time" or "datetime" values as Strings, XML schema formats are used - the same that are used for transmission in XML or JSON (see dateFormatAndStorage','Date and Time Format and Storage overview for details). The multipleStorage feature works by transforming from List to String and back inside the server-side DataSource.execute() method. Specifically, inbound DSRequests are transformed before methods that perform actual storage are called (executeUpdate() et al), and DSResponses received from these methods have multiple:true field values transformed back into Lists before DataSource.execute() returns the DSResponse. This transformation approach means that the built-in SQL, JPA and Hibernate connectors all support multipleStorage, and multipleStorage is also automatically available for any custom DataSource that is capable of storing String values, and implements its storage methods via overrides of executeUpdate(), executeAdd() et al as described in the writeCustomDataSource','custom DataSource overview. Note that when using the built-in SQL, JPA and Hibernate connectors, the underlying SQL column should be of 'text' type. The dbConfigTool','Database Configuration Tool will automatically generate columns of the correct type for a SQLDataSource. For JPA or Hibernate DataSources, just ensure the type of the Java bean property on your Java object is String. The default multipleStorage setting of null means that the "simpleString" MultipleFieldStorage approach will be used if: the field is of a known SimpleType the field is not a DataSourceField.foreignKey Otherwise, MultipleFieldStorage "none" will be used. <h4>Criteria and AdvancedCriteria handling</h4> For the built-in SQL, JPA and Hibernate connectors, when multipleStorage:"simpleString" or "json" is used, criteria are transformed to replicate the client-side filtering behavior for multiple:true fields, where possible. The following operators are supported with the same behavior as client-side filtering: all String-oriented operators including patternOperators','pattern operators, but not regexp/iRegexp isBlank / notBlank isNull / notNull inSet / notInSet equalsField / notEqualsField / iEqualsField / iNotEqualsField The following operators, which are supported for client-side filtering of multiple:true fields, are not supported for server filtering when using multipleStorage: greaterThan/lessThan(OrEqual) "between" and all other operators with OperatorValueType of "valueRange" regexp / iRegexp as noted above Note that for string-based filtering operators such as "equals", no characters which are part of the DataSourceField.multipleStorageSeparator may be used in the filter string. If any characters from the multipleStorageSeparator are present in the filter value, it will always fail to match. For "json" mode, the multipleStorageSeparator is effectively the String '","'.

If a DataSource allows modification of DataSource records through add, update and remove DataSource operations, or it contains one or more binary fields, one or more fields must be marked as the primary key.

There is no requirement that the primaryKey field be mapped to an actual "primary key" in your object model, web service, or database (though this is the most obvious and natural thing to do, of course). The only requirement is that the combined values of the primaryKey fields be unique for a given browser instance for the lifetime of the page. If using SmartClient's sqlDataSource','SQL engine and generating SQL tables using the dbConfigTool','Database Configuration Tool, the table column generated from a primaryKey field will have a unique constraint applied in the database table and, if the field is of type "sequence", the database column will also be created as an "identity column" in those databases that implement sequence-type handling with identity columns.

When a field is unconditionally required, things are simple: if the DynamicForm has a FormItem for that field, then the required validation passes if that FormItem has a value, and fails if it does not. If the form has no FormItem for the field, it can assume that the field has a value because otherwise it would have failed validation when we attempted to add it (when we are adding a record, we of course do know the full and complete state of the record - it is whatever we are about to add). When a field is conditionally required, the client can no longer assume that all required fields will have a value. It may be the case that the condition of requirement was not met when the record was added, but now it is. For example, consider these field definitions: &lt;field name="yearsAtCurrentAddress" type="integer" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousAddress" type="text" &gt; &lt;validator type="required" errorMessage="Previous address is required if you have been at your current address less than three years"&gt; &lt;applyWhen operator="and"&gt; &lt;criteria&gt; &lt;criterion fieldName="yearsAtCurrentAddress" operator="lessThan" value="3" /&gt; &lt;/criteria&gt; &lt;/applyWhen&gt; &lt;/validator&gt; &lt;/field&gt; Imagine a record for this DataSource is added where the user has entered a value of "3" for "yearsAtCurrentAddress", and no previous address. Later, the value of that field is changed to "2". If this is done using a form that is also showing the "previousAddress" field, we will know that "previousAddress" has not been provided, so we can fail the validation and the user will get a helpful error message explaining what the problem is. However, if the form does not also show the "previousAddress" field, we may choose to use an OperationBinding that uses OperationBinding.outputs','outputs to trim the record down to just the fields the form does contain, in the interests of avoiding information leakage. Or perhaps that value is automatically culled from the record before the client sees it by the application of a DataSourceField.viewRequires','declarative security rule. Whatever the reason, if the client does not have the complete record, it is not possible for the client to sensibly apply this validation. And because the client has no way of knowing if a value is missing because it is genuinely null, or because it has been trimmed away by the server, we must treat any null value with suspicion (unless it has a matching FormItem - the presence of the FormItem means that the user can edit the value, so it would make no sense to pair it with a trimmed record that excludes that field value). When this happens, we mark the validation as having passed on the client, but in need of running on the server. The server validation makes use of the "storedRecord" facility (look for the description of $storedRecord in the velocitySupport','Velocity support overview) to overlay the changed record on top of the existing record as it currently exists in the database. This gives the validator the complete record including both changed and unchanged values, so it is able to carry out the required check in a meaningful way. However, you should be aware that the combination of conditional "required" validators and DynamicForms that edit partial records can result in a validation that cannot run on the client and must do both a server roundtrip and a database fetch.

The "ntext" strategy is ignored for all other databases.</em> If you are integrating with Microsoft SQL Server, you may run into an issue with that database and double-byte character sets. Although the documentation indicates that string values are sent to the database as Unicode by default, they may undergo conversion at the database end, depending on the collation settings of the database. <a href=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/239530>This Microsoft support article</a> describes the situation, which is that Unicode is converted to the code page of the database before being used, in order to "provide backward compatibility with existing applications". To work around this, we provide an sqlStorageStrategy of "ntext". Fields that declare this strategy are inserted into queries using the "N syntax", like so: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UPDATE MyTable SET MyTextColumn = N'some text' WHERE MyPK = N'some key' This syntax overrides defaults and forces the database to treat strings as Unicode. Note that declaring a field to be of FieldType','type "ntext" is exactly equivalent to specifying type "text" and an sqlStorageStrategy of "ntext". If you declare a field of type "ntext" when the back-end database is something other than SQL Server, it will be treated as a normal field of type "text".

If you set this flag when your underlying database cannot support fractional seconds, it will be ignored.

These format strings should conform to the rules of the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html> Java SimpleDateFormat class</a>. Suitable format strings are provided for all default databases out of the box; if you need to override one or provide a new one, you do so as shown in this example: sql.MyNewDatabase.defaultDateTimeFormatWithMilliseconds: yy-MM-dd'T'hh.mm.ss.SSS Note that this property only controls the persistence of milliseconds into the database; there is no built-in support for sub-second elements of datetimes in any SmartClient visual components.

		/** (Read only) Server-side setting that causes values for fields of type "integer" or "float" to be represented as Strings when delivered to a web browser, in order to avoid mangling values which cannot be represented faithfully in JavaScript. JavaScript has a single "Number" type which internally stores numbers in a format equivalent to Java's "Double" - double-precision floating point. This means it cannot represent the full range of Java's Long type: Java Longs can represent integral values between -2^63 to 2^63-1, whereas JavaScript Number can only represent exact integer values between -2^53 and 2^53. Similarly, JavaScript's Number type cannot represent Java's unlimited-size BigInteger or unlimited-precision BigDecimal objects at all. The stringInBrowser setting can be used to deliver numeric values as Strings to the browser. This is intended to allow read-only display and successful round-tripping of the numeric value, however, it will not cause number-oriented features such as SpinnerItem, Slider, ListGrid.showGridSummary','ListGrid summaries or range-checking Validator','validators or AdvancedCriteria','criteria to actually work. If stringInBrowser is not set, the default behavior is configured by the server.properties setting datasource.defaultStringInBrowser. If this flag is false, numeric values are delivered to the client as numbers, even where this will lead to a loss of precision. If the flag is true (which is the the default), the behavior is to prevent range overflow for numeric values: Java values of type Long, BigInteger and BigDecimal will be delivered as String only if they exceed JavaScript's number range. Client-side validation will allow inputs that are outside of JavaScript's normal integer range, and such numbers will remain as Strings after validation, instead of being converted to Numbers Values submitted to the server will be converted to BigInteger if they exceed the range of Java's Long type. This happens during DSRequest validation, before any defined dmiOverview','DMI methods are called. This default set of behaviors is intended to automatically deal with cases like numeric DataSourceField.primaryKey or DataSourceField.foreignKey values that are never used as numbers, but happen to use the full Java Long range. To disable the above behaviors, set stringInBrowser="false". If stringInBrowser is explicitly set to true: the value for the field will always be delivered to the browser as a String (no attempt is made to detect the value as out of range / too high precision) client-side validation will do a check for valid format only, and always leave the value as a String.

Note that responses delivered as JSON or XML, such as responses from the servletDetails','RESTHandler servlet, are not affected. This setting applies only to responses delivered to a web browser. The entirety of stringInBrowser processing can be completely disabled by setting server.properties flag datasource.disableStringInBrowser to true.

If you are returning Java Beans as your DSResponse data, normally each dataSource field receives the value of the same-named Java Bean property, that is, a field "zipCode" is populated by looking for "getZipCode()" on the objects passed as DSResponse data. You can use valueXPath to retrieve properties from subobjects, so long as a chain of getter methods exists that corresponds to the valueXPath. For example, a valueXPath of "address/zipCode" expects to call "getAddress()" on the bean(s) passed to DSResponse.setData(), followed by "getZipCode()" on whatever object "getAddress()" returns. When you are saving data, the inbound DSRequest values, available as a Java Map, will use just dataSource field names as Map keys, not the valueXPath used to derive them. However, to achieve bidirectional valueXPath binding, you can use the server-side method dataSource.setProperties() to use the valueXPath when setting properties on your server object model. When applied as a setter, an XPath like "address/zipCode" attempts "getAddress()" followed by "setZipCode()" on the returned object. JXPath also has some ability to auto-create intervening objects if they are missing, such as auto-creating an "address" subobject when applying "address/zipCode" as a valueXPath. See the <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jxpath/' target='_blank'>JXPath</a> library documentation for complete details, including other types of server object models supported, such as server-side XML.

A list of fields can be expressed using OperationBinding.outputs or DSRequest.outputs; in the absence of those, the entire set of fields defined in the DataSource is implied.

		/** (Read only) This property indicates that this field should be represented by a custom expression embedded in the WHERE clause of the generated SQL, instead of the generated expression containing this field name that would ordinarily be used. You use this property when you have to accomodate some special way of using a field's value in criteria, other than by directly comparing it to the criteria. For example, if you have a column that contains bit-packed information you will generally need to perform a bitwise AND to filter on that column, rather than an equality check. In this case, you would use a customCriteriaExpression something like this (in Oracle): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BITAND(myField, $criteria.myField)+0 = $criteria.myField Or this (in MySQL or SQL Server): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myField & $criteria.myField = $criteria.myField As this example shows, a customCriteriaExpression is expected to be a complete logical expression that provides both sides of the comparison. After Velocity processing, this example would result in SQL similar to this (for the MySQL case); the colored part comes entirely from the customCriteriaExpression: SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE <font color='blue'>myField & 32 = 32</font> customCriteriaExpression can also be used with AdvancedCriteria. Note that the point mentioned above, about a customCriteriaExpression being a complete logical expression that provides both sides of the comparison still applies. This means that when you use customCriteriaExpression in conjunction with AdvancedCriteria, you effectively switch off support for different OperatorIds to be used on that field, unless you use Velocity expressions containing the special $criteriaOperator variable (see below). When you use customCriteriaExpression with AdvancedCriteria, the way you access criteria values differs slightly. One option is to use the $advancedCriteria Velocity variable, as described in the "Using AdvancedCriteria" section of the customQuerying','custom querying overview. However, this variable only returns the value from the first Criterion that uses the field, as found by depth-first search. If your AdvancedCriteria contains multiple references to this field, this will not be satisfactory. Therefore, specifically for customCriteriaExpression, we provide another Velocity variable, $criteriaValue. This variable means "the value on a Criterion referencing this field". An example may serve to clarify this: Assume you need to extend the above example to filter records where a certain bit is set OR a certain other bit is set. An AdvancedCriteria like this would be required (note that the choice of "equals" as the operator in these clauses is completely arbitrary - as discussed above, the operator is ignored when we have a customCriteriaExpression, so it would make no difference to the end product if we had used different operators here): { _constructor: "AdvancedCriteria", operator: "or", criteria: [ { fieldName: "myField", operator: "equals", value: 32 }, { fieldName: "myField", operator: "equals", value: 64 }, ] } If you used the customCriteriaExpression from above unchanged with this criteria, the following SQL would be generated (in the MySQL case): SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE myField & null = null OR myField & null = null This is because $criteria is a variable that only works correctly with simple criteria. If you changed the $criteria references in the expression to $advancedCriteria, the generated SQL would be: SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE myField & 32 = 32 OR myField & 32 = 32 This is because $advancedCriteria always returns the first value it finds for a particular field, as described above. However, if you change the expression so it reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myField & $criteriaValue = $criteriaValue you will now get the correct SQL generated: SELECT myField, myOtherField FROM myTable WHERE myField & 32 = 32 OR myField & 64 = 64 Similar to $criteriaValue, we provide a special variable, $criteriaOperator. This is intended for use in Velocity expressions, so that your customCriteriaExpression can process different operators in different ways. How you choose to interpret an operator is entirely up to you; this variable is both advanced and rarely used. This example is contrived and does not show a usage that would be remotely likely in a real application, but it does show how to use the variable in a Velocity expression: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myField #if ($criteriaOperator == "greaterThan") & #else | #end $criteriaValue = $criteriaValue For simple criteria, note that $criteriaOperator will vary depending on field type and the TextMatchStyle','textMatchStyle in force, as follows: Text fields with textMatchStyle "substring" - "iContains" Text fields with textMatchStyle "startsWith" - "iStartsWith" Text fields with textMatchStyle "exact" - "iEquals" All other cases (including text fields with textMatchStyle "exactCase") - "equals" You can use Velocity expressions in your customCriteriaExpressions, and the velocitySupport','usual context variables are available. Note that the results of Velocity evaluations are automatically quoted and escaped by default; this behavior can be switched off - see DataSourceField.autoQuoteCustomExpressions','autoQuoteCustomExpressions, and particularly note the warnings about its use. Note that this property only applies to users of the SmartClient server using dataSources of type "sql".

		/** (Read only) This property is similar to DataSourceField.customUpdateExpression','customUpdateExpression; its value is used during "add" operations. If you do not specify this property, but do specify a customUpdateExpression, the customUpdateExpression is used instead. Everything that applies to customUpdateExpression also applies to this property, including the observation that fields which specify a DataSourceField.customSelectExpression','customSelectExpression but no corresponding customUpdateExpression or customInsertExpression, will be ignored when adding new records. As with customUpdateExpression, this property is only intended to be used when you have a need to customize the actual SQL. If you simply want to use a server-derived value in the query, you should use transactionChaining','Transaction Chaining, dmiOverview','DMI, or a serverScript','server script instead. <h3>customInsertExpression with primaryKey fields</h3> if you use customInsertExpression to derive a value for a DataSourceField.primaryKey','primaryKey field, the key value will not by default be available to the framework, so the built-in cache synchronization system will not work. It may be possible to to work around this with the DataSourceField.autoGenerated','autoGenerated flag, as described below, but otherwise you must also create a OperationBinding.cacheSyncOperation','cacheSyncOperation which can retrieve the record just added to the database. Please also see the documentation for SequenceMode','SequenceMode "none", which talks further about cacheSyncOperation. Typically, primaryKey fields that need to be auto-generated are implemented using a sequence field, which at the database level translates to either an actual sequence, or an auto-increment or "identity" column. JDBC drivers have special support for such columns, so we are able to determine the generated value. This is important for primaryKey fields because, without it, we cannot re-fetch the record just inserted for cache synchronization purposes, as described above. Where a value is generated by something other than a sequence field, this special ability is lost - or at least, it is no longer guaranteed to be present. There are use cases where this may seem to be a restriction. A common case would be where you wish to use a generated UUID as primaryKey value, rather than an ordinary ascending sequence. If you had intended to do this using the database itself - for example, specifying a customInsertExpression that calls something like MySQL's UUID() built-in function - this is potentially a problem. What we would recommend in this case and anything similar, is to use the general ability for field values to be generated by application code, as described above. (Note, if you want to have application code generate values for primaryKey fields, you may need to use an OperationBinding','operationBinding that specifies OperationBinding.providesMissingKeys','providesMissingKeys). That said, different database vendors implement their JDBC drivers in different ways, and with the SQLDataSource and certain database products it is possible to retrieve values that were generated at the database level by a customInsertExpression that expresses either a user-defined function call or an inline subselect, as long as the field is marked with the autoGenerated flag. Because this behavior is potentially useful, we do not inhibit it; however, we also do not recommend that you make use of it, because the behavior is not portable across databases, and may also not be portable across JDBC driver versions (because the behavior is unspecified and undocumented, and relies on implementation details that may change). Databases where this behavior has been observed to work include Oracle, Postgres and HSQLDB; databases where this behavior is known not to work include MySQL, SQL Server, DB2 and Firebird (the latter because its JDBC driver does not support the getGeneratedKeys() API) Note that this property only applies to users of the SmartClient server using dataSources of type "sql".

When exporting, the format string provided to Excel contains the currency symbol for the current locale of the SmartClient application, and not a placeholder currency symbol that would make Excel pick up a currency symbol based on the operating system locale. We do this to ensure that the spreadsheet reflects the <em>application's</em> localization, rather than the localization of the current user's computer, because they may be different. <h3>Rounding differences</h3> The approach to rounding a positive number to a set number of decimal places is fairly universally agreed upon for non-specialized requirements: add 0.5 (or 0.05, or 0.005, or whatever) to the number and then truncate. This leads to the well understood convention that numbers exactly halfway between two possible rounding outcomes, go to the larger one. So 7.5 becomes 8 and 7.15 becomes 7.2. However, there is no such universal agreement when it come to rounding negative numbers. Some take the view that you should round by taking the number to the larger absolute value, so -7.15 becomes -7.2. Others feel that you should round by taking the number to the larger value in the sense of it being "less negative", so -7.15 becomes -7.1. SmartClient formatting takes the first approach and rounds negative numbers away from zero. We do this simply because that is what Java DecimalFormat does. Unfortunately, Excel does the opposite. Therefore, you will see rounding differences on negative numbers on exact 50% boundaries: SmartClient will format -7.15 as -7.2, while Excel will format the same value as -7.1. <h3>Different treatment of '#'</h3> Both SmartClient and Excel use '#' to mean "digit, do not show zeroes". However, Excel does not implement this strictly in the integer part when the number it is formatting has a value of 0 in the integer part. So, with a format of "#.##", the value 0.25 is formatted as "0.25". SmartClient (like Java DecimalFormat) is strict: with that format, 0.25 is formatted as ".25"; if you want to match Excel's output, you must use the format "0.##". <h3>Miscellaneous edge cases</h3> There is quite a lot of variation in behavior between Java DecimalFormat and Excel around the edges. For actual error cases - for example, a format string that just contains nonsense - it is normal and expected that the SmartClient behavior and the Excel behavior do not match - this is just two systems producing different garbage out for the same garbage in, which is to be expected. For valid but weird usages - for example, a format with multiple percent signs - SmartClient's formatting is in line with what DecimalFormat does, unless DecimalFormat throws an Exception, in which case we just do the thing that seems most sensible, or the thing that was easiest to implement. Known differences in behavior in edge cases include: SmartClient ignores formatting characters in the number part of the format string, whereas Excel rejects the format (this behavior may vary with different releases of Excel and supposedly compatible libraries: POI, for example, will accept such format strings). If you attempt to format 5.175 with the format string "#b0.#a#", SmartClient will return "5.72", and Excel will reject the format SmartClient ignores quoted characters in the number part of the format string, whereas Excel preserves them. If you attempt to format 5.175 with the format string "#'b'0.#'a'#", SmartClient will return "5.72", and Excel will return "b5.7a2" If you specify the empty string as a format string, SmartClient returns the result of calling toString() on the number; Excel uses the built-in "General" format. These two approaches will generally give the same or very similar results, but that is really a coincidence: the correct way to obtain matching results in the browser and the spreadsheet is to specify a valid format string If you specify a format string that contains no number part (ie, no '#' or '0' characters), SmartClient does what DecimalFormat does, which is to output the integer part of the number alongside the fixed part of the format. Excel just outputs the fixed part. So, if you attempt to format -5.3 with the format string "'Hello world'", SmartClient will output "-Hello world5", whereas Excel will output just "Hello world" If you specify multiple percent signs in the format, SmartClient treats all but the first one as static text, so 0.5 formatted with "#%%%" is "50%%%" (ie, all the signs are preserved but there is only one multiplcation by 100). Excel multiplies for each percent sign, so 0.5 formatted with "#%%%" is "500000%%%" <h3>Date format functionality not supported by Excel</h3> The following date/time/datetime functionality is not supported by Excel; if you use formatters that use any of this functionality, your values will be exported to Excel incorrectly formatted. In cases like this, we recommend that you use a separate exportFormat, with the intent of exporting your values in a way that is similar to your application formatting (which would be specified with the DataSourceField.format','format property), but within the confines of what Excel supports. Fiscal year, week and day (LL, LLLL, C, CC, c, cc) Week in year (w, ww) Day in year (D, DD) Day number in week (u) Explicit control over whether to use 12- or 24-hour notation. In Excel, this is implied by the presence or absence of the AM/PM designator If the user's operating system locale is different to the locale in use in the SmartClient application, day and month names may be different in the spreadsheet <h3>Number format functionality not supported by Excel</h3> The only SmartClient number-formatting functionality not supported for export to Excel is "multiply by 1000 and show as per mille". <h3>Limit on number of custom Excel formats</h3> Excel limits the number of custom format strings in a single spreadsheet to somewhere between 200 and 250, depending on your locale and language. Hitting this limit in an export would require hundreds of field definitions, each defining unique FormatStrings. If you do hit the limit, the only workaround is to use fewer unique FormatStrings.

		/** (Read only) For a field of FieldType','type "sequence" on a DataSource with DataSource.serverType','serverType:"sql", this flag indicates that the field is implicitly bound to a sequence. This setting means that SmartClient does not expect to find a value for the field in "add" operations, even if it is marked as a DataSourceField.primaryKey','primaryKey, as such fields usually are. It also means that SmartClient does not attempt to retrieve the field value from an actual database sequence, instead relying on the JDBC driver to return the generated value (see the note on sequenceMode below). Implicitly bound columns are a syntactic convenience provided by some databases to simulate the "auto-increment" or "identity" columns available natively in other products, without the underlying sequence having to be explicitly referenced in SQL queries. Currently, these database products support this idea: PostgreSQL has had a "serial" column type for a long time - <a href=http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL> http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL</a> DB2 has long supported a "GENERATED AS IDENTITY" notation for numeric fields. This may or may not be implemented with a sequence - the documentation does not specify - but we support it via the implicitSequence mechanism because it is so similar to the implicit sequence approach in Oracle. <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2z10.doc.apsg/src/tpc/db2z_identitycols.htm"> http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2z10.doc.apsg/src/tpc/db2z_identitycols.htm</a> Oracle introduced a "GENERATED AS IDENTITY" notation for numeric fields in version 12c - <a href=http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1.php> http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1.php</a> If you have columns like these in your database, declare them as type "sequence" and mark them with the implicitSequence flag. NOTE: If you use this property, you should also set the DataSource.sequenceMode','DataSource sequenceMode to "jdbcDriver". This is necessary because SmartClient cannot directly query the implicit sequence that is being used behind the scenes, so we must rely on the JDBC driver to do that. If you use DataSource.autoDeriveSchema','autoDeriveSchema to automatically derive a dataSource from table metadata, SmartClient attempts to identify these special Oracle and Postgres columns by heuristic examination of the metadata. When it identifies such a column, it marks the corresponding dataSourceField implicitSequence: true, and changes the sequenceMode on the DataSource to "jdbcDriver". If your table contains one of these columns and SmartClient does not automatically identify it, bear in mind that you can always set this flag manually, even if you are using autoDeriveSchema. This setting has no effect for non-SQL dataSources, or for databases other than those mentioned above.

		/** (Read only) Indicates this field should be fetched from another, related DataSource. The incluedFrom attribute should be of the form "dataSourceId.fieldName", for example: &lt;field includeFrom="supplyItem.itemName"/&gt; A DataSourceField.foreignKey declaration must exist between the two DataSources, establishing either a 1-to-1 relationship or a many-to-1 relationship from this DataSource to the related DataSource. The inclusion can be indirect (traverse multiple DataSources) so long as there is a chain of foreignKey declarations from the target DataSource to the DataSource where the includeFrom field is declared. For including from a related DataSource where there are multiple related records, see DataSourceField.includeSummaryFunction','includeSummaryFunction. DataSourceField.name will default to the name of the included field, or you can specify a different name. If both DataSources are SQLDataSources, HibernateDataSources or JPADataSources (with Hibernate as the provider) the related data will be retrieved via a SQL join and criteria and sort directions applied to the field work normally (they become part of the generated SQL query). Otherwise, the related data will be retrieved via performing a DSRequest against the related DataSource once the data from the primary DataSource has been retrieved. In this case, criteria or sorting directions applied to the included field are only allowed if data paging is not in use (for example ListGrid.dataFetchMode:"basic"); otherwise, criteria and sort direction are ignored for the included field and a warning is logged on the server. Editing included fields An included field is DataSourceField.canEdit','canEdit:false by default. Note that included fields are not updatable, even if you set canEdit:true; the server will simply drop values for included fields if client code sends them. When thinking about editing an included field value, typically what is really intended is to edit the value of the foreignKey field. For example, take the scenario of a system that tracks accounts and the employees assigned to manage them. Given a DataSource "account" related one-to-one with DataSource "employee" by a "managerId" foreignKey field, we might declare an includeFrom so that the name of the account manager can be shown with each "account" record. Editing the manager's name while viewing the account would be intended to pick a new account manager, and not to change the legal name of the employee who happens to be the current account manager. To correctly set up this scenario, declare an includeFrom field that is hidden, but is used as the DataSourceField.displayField','displayField for the foreign key field. Setting useLocalDisplayFieldValue to true will ensure the display field value is picked up from the record currently being edited: &lt;field name="managerId" foreignKey="employee.id" displayField="managerName" useLocalDisplayFieldValue="true"/&gt; &lt;field name="managerName" includeFrom="employee.name" hidden="true"/&gt; Now: the "managerId" foreignKey field is shown in grids and forms, but takes its displayed value from the hidden includeFrom field. the automatically chosen editor will be a SelectItem with SelectItem.optionDataSource','optionDataSource set to "employees": it will allow picking a different "employee" record from the "employee" DataSource saving will save the ID of a new "employee" record to the "managerId" foreign key field, as intended You can alternatively set editorType="ComboBoxItem" on the "managerId" field to allow typeahead search of the "employee" DataSource. Note that the DataSourceField.foreignDisplayField attribute allows developers to have a different fieldName be used locally as a displayField from the field name for the display field in the foreign dataSource.

		/** (Read only) For a field that uses DataSourceField.includeFrom, specifies which DataSourceField.foreignKey','foreignKey field should be used to find records in the related DataSource. includeVia only needs to be set when you have more than one foreignKey to the same related DataSource. If you have multiple foreignKeys to multiple different DataSources, there is no need to set includeVia. For example, perhaps you have a DataSource "moneyTransfer" where each record represents a money transfer, where the source and payment currencies are different, and the list of currencies is stored in a related DataSource "currency". Each "moneyTransfer" record is linked to 2 "currency" records, through two different foreignKey fields, "sourceCurrencyId" and "paymentCurrencyId". The following declarations would be required to use includeFrom to get a include the field "currencySymbol" from each of the two related "currency" records. &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="sourceCurrencyId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="paymentCurrencyId"/&gt; <h3>SQL Templating and includeVia</h3> The includeVia feature uses SQL table aliases in the generated SQL when generating multiple SQL joins to the same SQL table. When using customQuerying','SQL Templating, it's sometimes necessary to know the names of the aliases in the generated SQL. The table alias used can be configured via setting DataSourceField.relatedTableAlias on the foreignKey field, for example, using the declarations below, aliases "source" and "payment" would be used for the two "currency" tables. &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="source"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="payment"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="sourceCurrencyId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="paymentCurrencyId"/&gt; <h3>Multiple indirection and relatedTableAlias</h3> Sometimes you may have two includeFrom fields that include a field which is itself included from another DataSource, for example: &lt;field name="sourceCurId" nativeName="sourceCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="source"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.groupName" includeVia="sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurId" nativeName="paymentCurrencyId" foreignKey="currency.id" relatedTableAlias="payment"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencySymbol" includeFrom="currency.currencySymbol" includeVia="paymentCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.groupName" includeVia="paymentCurId"/&gt; .. where the "currency" DataSource used above is related to the "currencyGroup" DataSource via fields: &lt;field name="groupId" type="integer" foreignKey="currencyGroup.id" relatedTableAlias="group"/&gt; &lt;field name="groupName" type="text" includeFrom="currencyGroup.groupName"/&gt; Fields "sourceCurrencyGroup" and "paymentCurrencyGroup" include a field that is itself an included field. In this case "currencyGroup" table will be referenced two times, and its relatedTableAlias defined in "currency" DataSource will be prefixed with the includeVia value to make aliases unique in generated SQL: "sourceCurId_group" and "paymentCurId_group". The same aliases would be used if "sourceCurrencyGroup" and "paymentCurrencyGroup" fields were to include "currencyGroup.groupName" indirectly: &lt;field name="sourceCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="paymentCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="paymentCurId"/&gt; This works the same for more complex relationships. If we add a "moneyTransferDetail" DataSource to the sample above which has multiple references to "moneyTransfer" DataSource and would include fields from "currency" and "currencyGroup" DataSources: &lt;field name="mtId" nativeName="moneyTransferId" type="integer" foreignKey="moneyTransfer.id" relatedTableAlias="main" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainTransferName" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.name" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainSourceSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainSourceGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainPaymentSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mainPaymentGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtId" /&gt; &lt;field name="mtPrevId" nativeName="moneyTransferPreviousId" type="integer" foreignKey="moneyTransfer.id" relatedTableAlias="prev" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousTransferName" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.name" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousSourceSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousSourceGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.sourceCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousPaymentSymbol" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencySymbol" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousPaymentGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.paymentCurrencyGroup" includeVia="mtPrevId" /&gt; In this scenario the "currencyGroup" table will be joined 4 times - for all main/prev transfer and payment/source currency combinations. So, aliases will be prefixed with both intermediate includeVia values: "mtId_sourceCurId_group", "mtId_paymentCurId_group", "mtPrevId_sourceCurId_group", "mtPrevId_paymentCurId_group". It is also allowed to specify a series of FK fields in includeVia, for example "moneyTransferDetail" could declare: &lt;field name="mainSourceCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="mtId.sourceCurId"/&gt; &lt;field name="mainPaymentCurrencyGroup" includeFrom="moneyTransfer.currency.currencyGroup.groupName" includeVia="mtId.paymentCurId"/&gt; In this case the prefix used for table aliases will be the includeVia value with "_" substituted for ".", so the table aliases will be "mtId_sourceCurId_group" and "mtId_paymentCurId_group". Note that if DataSourceField.relatedTableAlias','related table alias is not specified, then we don't make any guarantees what alias will be generated. Note that Oracle has a limit of 30 characters on identifier names. We limit table aliases to 30 characters all databases despite actual database in use to support portability across databases. If the generated table alias would exceed 30 chars, we instead use a generated and unpredictable value like "a123". To avoid hitting this limit for the advanced cases discussed above: use relatively short strings for relatedTableAlias for rare, multi-step inclusion scenarios where multiple field names are used as a prefix, if field names are very long in order to match database column names, you can use a shorter field name and use DataSourceField.nativeName to specify the underlying column name (this is demonstrated in samples above - note field "mtPrevId")

Also note that DataSourceField.javaCollectionClass can be specified if a particular Collection or Map type is needed, and DataSourceField.javaKeyClass can be specified for a field of type java.util.Map.

		/** (Read only) Indicates that this field should always be Array-valued. If the value derived from DataSource.dataFormat','XML or JSON data is singular, it will be wrapped in an Array. JPA and Hibernate DataSources use multiple:true as part of the declaration of One-To-Many and Many-to-Many relations - see jpaHibernateRelations for details. <h4>Criteria on multiple:true fields: client-side filtering</h4> For simple Criteria, the criteria value is compared to each field value in the multiple:true field, according to the DSRequest.textMatchStyle','textMatchStyle. If any field value matches the filter value, the field is considered to match the criteria. For AdvancedCriteria, for normal OperatorId','search operators the field value is considered as matching the Criterion if any of the field values match the Criterion. Specifically, this is true of all operators that have an OperatorValueType','operatorValueType of "fieldType" or "valueRange". For operators that compare against other fields in same record, such as "equalsField", if the other field is not multiple:true, matching works the same as for normal operators, that is, as if criterion.value directly contained the value rather than the name of another field. If the other field is also multiple:true, only "equalsField", "notEqualsField", "iEqualsField" and "iNotEqualsField" are allowed (any other operator will cause a warning and be ignored) and the set of values in the field must be identical (aside from case, for operators prefixed with "i") and in identical order to match. For the inSet operator, the field matches if there is any intersection between the field values and the array of values provided in criterion.value. notInSet is the reverse. Finally, for "isBlank", "notBlank", "isNull" and "notNull", an empty Array is considered non-null. For example, if you use dataFormat:"json" and the field value is provided to the browser as [] (JSON for an empty Array), the field is considered non-null. <h4>Server-side Representation and Storage</h4> Values for multiple:true fields appear as Java Lists when received in server code such as a DMI. The SmartClient Server supports simple storage of values that are multiple:true, controlled via the DataSourceField.multipleStorage setting. For server-side behavior of JPA and Hibernate relation fields that are multiple:true, see jpaHibernateRelations. For non-relation fields, the SmartClient Server supports simple storage of values that are multiple:true, controlled via the DataSourceField.multipleStorage setting, with some limited support for server-side filtering, as described in the DataSourceField.multipleStorage docs. For the built-in SQL, Hibernate and JPA connectors, if criteria are specified for a multiple:true field where multipleStorage is null or "none", the SmartClient server knows nothing about how the multiple values are stored, so as a fallback the criteria will operate as though the field were a normal, non-multiple "text" field. This will generally not match the client-side filtering behavior described above, so filtering should either be performed entirely on the client (for example, via ListGrid.dataFetchMode','dataFetchMode:"local" or entirely on the server (via ResultSet.useClientFiltering:"false") The server-side filtering is done through a criteria transform which happens with DataSource.transformMultipleFields','transformMultipleFields. <h4>XML Serialization</h4> Specifically for XML serialization and deserialization, multiple:true behaves similarly to the <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=soap+array' target='_blank'>SOAP array idiom</a>, that is, there will be a "wrapper element" named after the field name, whose contents will be several elements of the specified DataSourceField.type','field.type. For example, Layout.members is declared with type:"Canvas", multiple:true. The correct XML format is thus: &lt;VLayout&gt; &lt;members&gt; &lt;Canvas ID="myCanvas" ... /&gt; &lt;ListGrid ID="myGrid" .../&gt; &lt;Toolstrip ID="myToolStrip" ... /&gt; &lt;/members&gt; &lt;/VLayout&gt; See DataSourceField.childTagName for customizing the tagName used for subelements.

		/** (Read only) How values for a DataSourceField.multiple','multiple:true field should be stored. On the server, field values for multiple:true fields are represented as Java Lists in DSRequest and DSResponse objects, but when multipleStorage is used, are ultimately stored as Strings. This storage mechanism is "denormalized" in the sense of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization' target='_blank'>database normalization</a> because the field contains a compound value rather than an atomic value. Specifically, this makes the field harder to use with database features like SQL joins, since its value cannot be directly compared to other, singular fields. For this reason, there's really only a narrow set of cases where it makes sense to use this storage mechanism, consider it if: the values don't appear in any other tables or columns elsewhere in your database (so joins and other comparisons wouldn't be possible anyway) there is no authoritative list of all possible values, or even of popular values; it's basically freeform, like arbitrary, uncurated "tags" applied to photos or links A multiple:true field can be of any SimpleType, including "date", "time", "datetime", "float", "int" etc. Type will be preserved across a store and reload cycle, so for example a List of values for a field of type "int" will arrive at the server in a DSRequest as a List of Integer, be stored as a String, but appear again as a List of Integer inside a DSResponse. When storing "date", "time" or "datetime" values as Strings, XML schema formats are used - the same that are used for transmission in XML or JSON (see dateFormatAndStorage','Date and Time Format and Storage overview for details). The multipleStorage feature works by transforming from List to String and back inside the server-side DataSource.execute() method. Specifically, inbound DSRequests are transformed before methods that perform actual storage are called (executeUpdate() et al), and DSResponses received from these methods have multiple:true field values transformed back into Lists before DataSource.execute() returns the DSResponse. This transformation approach means that the built-in SQL, JPA and Hibernate connectors all support multipleStorage, and multipleStorage is also automatically available for any custom DataSource that is capable of storing String values, and implements its storage methods via overrides of executeUpdate(), executeAdd() et al as described in the writeCustomDataSource','custom DataSource overview. Note that when using the built-in SQL, JPA and Hibernate connectors, the underlying SQL column should be of 'text' type. The dbConfigTool','Database Configuration Tool will automatically generate columns of the correct type for a SQLDataSource. For JPA or Hibernate DataSources, just ensure the type of the Java bean property on your Java object is String. The default multipleStorage setting of null means that the "simpleString" MultipleFieldStorage approach will be used if: the field is of a known SimpleType the field is not a DataSourceField.foreignKey Otherwise, MultipleFieldStorage "none" will be used. <h4>Criteria and AdvancedCriteria handling</h4> For the built-in SQL, JPA and Hibernate connectors, when multipleStorage:"simpleString" or "json" is used, criteria are transformed to replicate the client-side filtering behavior for multiple:true fields, where possible. The following operators are supported with the same behavior as client-side filtering: all String-oriented operators including patternOperators','pattern operators, but not regexp/iRegexp isBlank / notBlank isNull / notNull inSet / notInSet equalsField / notEqualsField / iEqualsField / iNotEqualsField The following operators, which are supported for client-side filtering of multiple:true fields, are not supported for server filtering when using multipleStorage: greaterThan/lessThan(OrEqual) "between" and all other operators with OperatorValueType of "valueRange" regexp / iRegexp as noted above Note that for string-based filtering operators such as "equals", no characters which are part of the DataSourceField.multipleStorageSeparator may be used in the filter string. If any characters from the multipleStorageSeparator are present in the filter value, it will always fail to match. For "json" mode, the multipleStorageSeparator is effectively the String '","'.

Tree-structured data requires that nodes have a unique Tree.idField','idField, with the parent/child relationship expressed through the Tree.parentIdField','parentIdField. This implies that binding a Tree to a DataSource requires that the DataSource have a singular primaryKey, and that the primaryKey field is also the idField, as described in the treeDataBinding','tree databinding overview A DataSource that can only perform the "fetch" operation does not require a primaryKey unless it contains binaryFields','binary fields. If a DataSource allows modification of DataSource records through add, update and remove DataSource operations, or it contains one or more binary fields, one or more fields must be marked as the primary key.

There is no requirement that the primaryKey field be mapped to an actual "primary key" in your object model, web service, or database (though this is the most obvious and natural thing to do, of course). The only requirement is that the combined values of the primaryKey fields be unique for a given browser instance for the lifetime of the page. If using SmartClient's sqlDataSource','SQL engine and generating SQL tables using the dbConfigTool','Database Configuration Tool, the table column generated from a primaryKey field will have a unique constraint applied in the database table and, if the field is of type "sequence", the database column will also be created as an "identity column" in those databases that implement sequence-type handling with identity columns.

Setting this property has the same effect as giving the field a ValidatorType','"required" validator. Note that required should not be set for a server-generated field, such as a sequence, or validation will fail on the client. <h3>Conditionally required fields</h3> Adding an Validator.applyWhen','applyWhen condition to a required validator introduces subtle complexities to the process of validating an existing record. The client is not guaranteed to know the the full and complete state of the record it is editing because it is common for a DynamicForm to be editing a subset of fields. When a field is unconditionally required, things are simple: if the DynamicForm has a FormItem for that field, then the required validation passes if that FormItem has a value, and fails if it does not. If the form has no FormItem for the field, it can assume that the field has a value because otherwise it would have failed validation when we attempted to add it (when we are adding a record, we of course do know the full and complete state of the record - it is whatever we are about to add). When a field is conditionally required, the client can no longer assume that all required fields will have a value. It may be the case that the condition of requirement was not met when the record was added, but now it is. For example, consider these field definitions: &lt;field name="yearsAtCurrentAddress" type="integer" /&gt; &lt;field name="previousAddress" type="text" &gt; &lt;validator type="required" errorMessage="Previous address is required if you have been at your current address less than three years"&gt; &lt;applyWhen operator="and"&gt; &lt;criteria&gt; &lt;criterion fieldName="yearsAtCurrentAddress" operator="lessThan" value="3" /&gt; &lt;/criteria&gt; &lt;/applyWhen&gt; &lt;/validator&gt; &lt;/field&gt; Imagine a record for this DataSource is added where the user has entered a value of "3" for "yearsAtCurrentAddress", and no previous address. Later, the value of that field is changed to "2". If this is done using a form that is also showing the "previousAddress" field, we will know that "previousAddress" has not been provided, so we can fail the validation and the user will get a helpful error message explaining what the problem is. However, if the form does not also show the "previousAddress" field, we may choose to use an OperationBinding that uses OperationBinding.outputs','outputs to trim the record down to just the fields the form does contain, in the interests of avoiding information leakage. Or perhaps that value is automatically culled from the record before the client sees it by the application of a DataSourceField.viewRequires','declarative security rule. Whatever the reason, if the client does not have the complete record, it is not possible for the client to sensibly apply this validation. And because the client has no way of knowing if a value is missing because it is genuinely null, or because it has been trimmed away by the server, we must treat any null value with suspicion (unless it has a matching FormItem - the presence of the FormItem means that the user can edit the value, so it would make no sense to pair it with a trimmed record that excludes that field value). When this happens, we mark the validation as having passed on the client, but in need of running on the server. The server validation makes use of the "storedRecord" facility (look for the description of $storedRecord in the velocitySupport','Velocity support overview) to overlay the changed record on top of the existing record as it currently exists in the database. This gives the validator the complete record including both changed and unchanged values, so it is able to carry out the required check in a meaningful way. However, you should be aware that the combination of conditional "required" validators and DynamicForms that edit partial records can result in a validation that cannot run on the client and must do both a server roundtrip and a database fetch.

The following additional strategies are available: "number" or "integer": store true as 1, false as 0 "singleChar10": store true as "1", false as "0" "singleCharYN": store true as "Y", false as "N" "singleCharTF": store true as "T", false as "F" "singleChar": store as a single character, using the values defined by DataSourceField.sqlTrueValue','sqlTrueValue and DataSourceField.sqlFalseValue','sqlFalseValue "string": store the entire values defined by DataSourceField.sqlTrueValue','sqlTrueValue and DataSourceField.sqlFalseValue','sqlFalseValue Fields of type "date", "time", and "datetime" The default strategy for these types is to use a native type that supports date and time values to the nearest second; the actual type used varies by database. The following additional strategies are available: "nativeDate": Use a native SQL DATE type "number" or "integer": Store the value as a plain numeric value "text": Store the value as a plain text value The "number" and "text" strategies for date/time/datetime fields are provided to allow transparent two-way mapping of legacy date values; you would not ordinarily use them in the absence of a legacy database. In both cases, the actual format of the number or text string is determined by specifying a DataSourceField.sqlDateFormat','sqlDateFormat on the field; if no format is specified, the framework defaults to "yyyyMMdd". Fields of type "text" <em>NOTE: This section is only applicable for users of Microsoft SQL Server. The "ntext" strategy is ignored for all other databases.</em> If you are integrating with Microsoft SQL Server, you may run into an issue with that database and double-byte character sets. Although the documentation indicates that string values are sent to the database as Unicode by default, they may undergo conversion at the database end, depending on the collation settings of the database. <a href=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/239530>This Microsoft support article</a> describes the situation, which is that Unicode is converted to the code page of the database before being used, in order to "provide backward compatibility with existing applications". To work around this, we provide an sqlStorageStrategy of "ntext". Fields that declare this strategy are inserted into queries using the "N syntax", like so: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UPDATE MyTable SET MyTextColumn = N'some text' WHERE MyPK = N'some key' This syntax overrides defaults and forces the database to treat strings as Unicode. Note that declaring a field to be of FieldType','type "ntext" is exactly equivalent to specifying type "text" and an sqlStorageStrategy of "ntext". If you declare a field of type "ntext" when the back-end database is something other than SQL Server, it will be treated as a normal field of type "text". This property only applies to users of the SmartClient server using dataSources of type "sql".

		/** (Read only) For fields of type "datetime", indicates whether the framework should attempt to preserve the millisecond part when persisting to native SQL datetime-type columns. Whether this is possible depends on the type and version of the underlying database product; some databases - for example SQL Server earlier than 2008 and MySQL versions earlier than 5.6 - do not provide fractional seconds support. If you set this flag when your underlying database cannot support fractional seconds, it will be ignored. Other than the two cases just mentioned which are known to fail, storeMilliseconds has been tested and is officially supported with the following products and minimum versions: Oracle 10g Microsoft SQL Server 2008 MySQL 5.6 PostgreSQL 9.1 HSQLDB 2.2 DB2 for Unix/Linux 9.7 Firebird 11.2 Informix IDS 11.5 Note that you can use DataSourceField.sqlStorageStrategy','sqlStorageStrategy to store a datetime value with sub-second precision in <em>any</em> database - see below. When the system generates SQL to insert or update datetime values including a millisecond element, it does so using a database-specific format string specified in property defaultDateTimeFormatWithMilliseconds in your server.properties file. These format strings should conform to the rules of the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html> Java SimpleDateFormat class</a>. Suitable format strings are provided for all default databases out of the box; if you need to override one or provide a new one, you do so as shown in this example: sql.MyNewDatabase.defaultDateTimeFormatWithMilliseconds: yy-MM-dd'T'hh.mm.ss.SSS Note that this property only controls the persistence of milliseconds into the database; there is no built-in support for sub-second elements of datetimes in any SmartClient visual components. See also the documentation for DataSource.trimMilliseconds for more details of how sub-second datetime elements are handled in the client-server flow. This property is only applicable to DataSources of DSServerType','serverType "sql" and fields of FieldType','type "datetime". It is ignored in all other cases. However, note that the built-in JPA and Hibernate dataSources will always persist millisecond values automatically if the underlying Java type, database and column support it. Finally, note that this property only has an effect on <em>native</em> datetime-type fields. When you use DataSourceField.sqlStorageStrategy','sqlStorageStrategy to store a temporal value in a text or number column, it is the DataSourceField.sqlDateFormat','sqlDateFormat you use that dictates the precision. For example, a field with sqlStorageStrategy:"text" and sqlDateFormat:"yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS" would store and retrieve with millisecond precsion; the same field with sqlDateFormat:"yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm" would store and retrieve with precision to the nearest minute only.

		/** (Read only) Server-side setting that causes values for fields of type "integer" or "float" to be represented as Strings when delivered to a web browser, in order to avoid mangling values which cannot be represented faithfully in JavaScript. JavaScript has a single "Number" type which internally stores numbers in a format equivalent to Java's "Double" - double-precision floating point. This means it cannot represent the full range of Java's Long type: Java Longs can represent integral values between -2^63 to 2^63-1, whereas JavaScript Number can only represent exact integer values between -2^53 and 2^53. Similarly, JavaScript's Number type cannot represent Java's unlimited-size BigInteger or unlimited-precision BigDecimal objects at all. The stringInBrowser setting can be used to deliver numeric values as Strings to the browser. This is intended to allow read-only display and successful round-tripping of the numeric value, however, it will not cause number-oriented features such as SpinnerItem, Slider, ListGrid.showGridSummary','ListGrid summaries or range-checking Validator','validators or AdvancedCriteria','criteria to actually work. If stringInBrowser is not set, the default behavior is configured by the server.properties setting datasource.defaultStringInBrowser. If this flag is false, numeric values are delivered to the client as numbers, even where this will lead to a loss of precision. If the flag is true (which is the the default), the behavior is to prevent range overflow for numeric values: Java values of type Long, BigInteger and BigDecimal will be delivered as String only if they exceed JavaScript's number range. Client-side validation will allow inputs that are outside of JavaScript's normal integer range, and such numbers will remain as Strings after validation, instead of being converted to Numbers Values submitted to the server will be converted to BigInteger if they exceed the range of Java's Long type. This happens during DSRequest validation, before any defined dmiOverview','DMI methods are called. This default set of behaviors is intended to automatically deal with cases like numeric DataSourceField.primaryKey or DataSourceField.foreignKey values that are never used as numbers, but happen to use the full Java Long range. To disable the above behaviors, set stringInBrowser="false". If stringInBrowser is explicitly set to true: the value for the field will always be delivered to the browser as a String (no attempt is made to detect the value as out of range / too high precision) client-side validation will do a check for valid format only, and always leave the value as a String. Numeric range validators are ignored client-side (always pass), but are still active server-side. AdvancedCriteria OperatorId','operators that check if values are in a particular range will always pass the field is treated as though DataSourceField.canFilter','canFilter:false were set, to avoid showing non-functional search interfaces to the user. Set canFilter="true" to avoid this effect This setting is recommended for presenting out-of-range issues or precision loss on fields that represent actual quantities (as opposed to primaryKey or foreignKey fields, which really represent IDs). To ensure unlimited-precision BigDecimal values are preserved, you should also set DataSourceField.javaClass. Note that responses delivered as JSON or XML, such as responses from the servletDetails','RESTHandler servlet, are not affected. This setting applies only to responses delivered to a web browser. The entirety of stringInBrowser processing can be completely disabled by setting server.properties flag datasource.disableStringInBrowser to true. This will cause all numeric values to be delivered as numbers without even attempting to detect if this will lead to a loss of precision. This setting overrides both the stringInBrowser field setting and the datasource.defaultStringInBrowser server.properties flag.

In the absence of a valueXPath, for JSON data the value for the field will be the value of the same-named property in the record object selected by DataSource.recordXPath','recordXPath. For XML data, the value will be the attribute or subelement named after the field name. For example, for a field "author" on a record element &lt;book&gt;, the following structures require no valueXPath: &lt;book author="Mark Jones"/&gt; &lt;book&gt; &lt;author&gt;Mark Jones&lt;/author&gt; &lt;/book&gt; If valueXPath is not required for your field because of the default handling described above, don't specify it, as it's slightly slower. To learn about XPath, try the following search: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=xpath+tutorial" target="_blank" >http://www.google.com/search?q=xpath+tutorial</a> Using valueXPath with the SmartClient server If you're using the SmartClient server to return data via the DSResponse object (or indirectly doing so using DataSource DMI), the valueXPath you specify on the DataSource fields will be applied to the data you return via the <a href='http://commons.apache.org/jxpath/' target='_blank'>JXPath</a> library. If you are returning Java Beans as your DSResponse data, normally each dataSource field receives the value of the same-named Java Bean property, that is, a field "zipCode" is populated by looking for "getZipCode()" on the objects passed as DSResponse data. You can use valueXPath to retrieve properties from subobjects, so long as a chain of getter methods exists that corresponds to the valueXPath. For example, a valueXPath of "address/zipCode" expects to call "getAddress()" on the bean(s) passed to DSResponse.setData(), followed by "getZipCode()" on whatever object "getAddress()" returns. When you are saving data, the inbound DSRequest values, available as a Java Map, will use just dataSource field names as Map keys, not the valueXPath used to derive them. However, to achieve bidirectional valueXPath binding, you can use the server-side method dataSource.setProperties() to use the valueXPath when setting properties on your server object model. When applied as a setter, an XPath like "address/zipCode" attempts "getAddress()" followed by "setZipCode()" on the returned object. JXPath also has some ability to auto-create intervening objects if they are missing, such as auto-creating an "address" subobject when applying "address/zipCode" as a valueXPath. See the <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jxpath/' target='_blank'>JXPath</a> library documentation for complete details, including other types of server object models supported, such as server-side XML.

A list of fields can be expressed using OperationBinding.outputs or DSRequest.outputs; in the absence of those, the entire set of fields defined in the DataSource is implied. You can override this behavior on a per-request basis by providing a DMI that just re-adds the names of the fields you want for that particular request to the "consolidated outputs". See the server-side Javadoc for DSRequest.getConsolidatedOutputs(). In addition to this behavior of trimming off values in fetched records, a field that fails a field-level security check (either this one or one of the two more specific checks, DataSourceField.viewRequiresRole','viewRequiresRole and DataSourceField.viewRequires','viewRequires) will be altered in the version of the dataSource returned to the client by the loadDSTag','&lt;loadDS&gt; JSP tag or dataSourceDeclaration','DataSourceLoader servlet.

The expected response to this request is a DSResponse sent via the RPC mechanism. If validation is successful, an empty response with the STATUS_SUCCESS status code is sufficient. If there are validation errors, the DSResponse should have the status set to STATUS_VALIDATION_ERROR and the errors should be set on the response via the addError()/setErrorReport() API on DSResponse. See the javadoc for DSResponse for details. See the Struts examples in [webroot]/examples/struts for usage examples.

	 * The DynamicForm manages a collection of FormItems which represent user input controls. The DynamicForm provides formLayout','layout, value management, validation and databinding for the controls it manages. To create a DynamicForm, set DynamicForm.fields to an Array of Objects describing the FormItems you want to use. For example: isc.DynamicForm.create({ fields:[ {name:"userName", type:"text"}, // creates a TextItem {name:"usState", type:"select"} // creates a SelectItem ] }) The item name is an identifier for the item that must be unique just within this form. It is used: as the name under which the item's value is stored in the form (the form's current values are accessible as DynamicForm.getValues','form.getValues() when retrieving the FormItem's current value (via DynamicForm.getValue','form.getValue()) to retrieve the item itself via DynamicForm.getItem','form.getItem() FormItems can also be created by binding the form to a DataSource via setDataSource(). In this case, FormItems are chosen based on the data type of the field - see FormItemType. You can override the automatically chosen FormItem via DataSourceField.editorType. When using DataSource binding, you can also add additional FormItems not specified in the DataSource, or override any properties on the automatically generated FormItems, without having to re-declare any information that comes from the DataSource. See the QuickStart Guide chapter on Data Binding for an overview. All FormItems share a common set of properties for controlling formLayout','form\n layout. Other properties common to all FormItems are documented on the FormItem class, and properties specific to particular FormItems are documented on the respective FormItems.

Either the user-visible title of the field (field.title) or the field's name (field.name) may be used. In all cases, if an operator is disallowed for the field (via DataSourceField.validOperators','field.validOperators at either the dataSource or field level), the operator character is ignored (treated as part of a literal value). By default, the case-insensitive version of the operator is used (eg, startsWith will actually use "iStartsWith"). To avoid this, explicitly set item.operator (the default operator) to any case sensitive operator (eg "equals" or "contains") and case sensitive operators will be used for user-entered expressions. Compound expressions (including "and" and "or") are allowed only for numeric or date/time types.

Also note that whatever you enter will be used literally, including any whitespace characters. For example if you input '== China ' then ' China ' will be the value.

Note that even with this value set to "none", native browser auto-completion may occur for log in forms (forms containing username and PasswordItem','password fields).

In some browsers any form redraw (including a redraw from a call to DynamicForm.setValues) will re-populate the form with the natively remembered login credentials. This can make it very difficult to control the values displayed to the user, as a call to 'setValues()' may appear to be ignored. While behavior varies by browser we have specifically observed this behavior in Safari. Moreover in this browser, if the user asks the browser to remember login credentials for a URL, any form with a password item and a text item may be auto-filled with the remembered login credentials, even if the form's configuration and field names differ from those on the login form. If an application has both an initial log in form, and a separate form within the application which makes contains a Password item (a use case might be an interface for a user with manager privileges for modifying other users' passwords), this will cause the second form to autofill with unexpected values. Should this arise, developers can avoid this by making the initial log in interface into a separate log in page from the main application page. This is often good practice in any case for reasons outlined in the "Authentication" section of the Quick Start guide.

In all cases, if an operator is disallowed for the field (via DataSourceField.validOperators','field.validOperators at either the dataSource or field level), the operator character is ignored (treated as part of a literal value). By default, the case-insensitive version of the operator is used (eg, startsWith will actually use "iStartsWith").

In some browsers any form redraw (including a redraw from a call to DynamicForm.setValues) will re-populate the form with the natively remembered login credentials. This can make it very difficult to control the values displayed to the user, as a call to 'setValues()' may appear to be ignored. While behavior varies by browser we have specifically observed this behavior in Safari. Moreover in this browser, if the user asks the browser to remember login credentials for a URL, any form with a password item and a text item may be auto-filled with the remembered login credentials, even if the form's configuration and field names differ from those on the login form. If an application has both an initial log in form, and a separate form within the application which makes contains a Password item (a use case might be an interface for a user with manager privileges for modifying other users' passwords), this will cause the second form to autofill with unexpected values. Should this arise, developers can avoid this by making the initial log in interface into a separate log in page from the main application page.

A Layout manages a set of "member" Canvases provided as Layout.members. Layouts can have both "members", whose position and size are managed by the Layout, and normal Canvas children, which manage their own position and size.

Layouts and Stacks may be nested to create arbitrarily complex layouts. Since Layouts can be either horizontally or vertically oriented, throughout the documentation of Layout and it's subclasses, the term "length" refers to the axis of stacking, and the term "breadth" refers to the other axis. Hence, "length" means height in the context of a VLayout or VStack, but means width in the context of an HLayout or HStack. To show a resizer bar after (to the right or bottom of) a layout member, set Canvas.showResizeBar','showResizeBar to true on that member component (not on the HLayout or VLayout). Resizer bars override Layout.membersMargin','membersMargin spacing. Like other Canvas subclasses, Layout and Stack components may have % width and height values.

ListGrid is a subclass of VLayout and consists of a number of member components. The standard set of members are automatically generated by the grid, and include (for example) the header (a Toolbar of buttons for each field) and the body (a GridRenderer displaying the actual data contained in the grid). The default value of gridComponents is an Array of ListGridComponents listing the standard components in their default order: gridComponents : ["filterEditor", "header", "body", "summaryRow"] You can override gridComponents to change the order of standard components. You can also omit standard components this way, although it more efficient to use the related "show" property if available (eg ListGrid.showFilterEditor). Note that this array must contain an entry for the "body" - listGrids with no body showing are unsupported. Advanced note: The live components generated for each of these standard ListGridComponent types may differ across different listGrids. For example if this grid has any ListGridField.frozen','frozen fields, the "body" entry will actually be created as an HLayout containing two GridRenderers (one for frozen fields, and one for unfrozen fields). This is really an implementation detail - the "body" entry in the gridComponents array simply specifies where the UI for the body should render within the ListGrid layout. By embedding a Canvas directly in this list you can add arbitrary additional components to the listGrid as members, and have them be displayed alongside the standard automatically generated parts of the ListGrid. Note that having added controls to gridComponents, you can still call APIs directly on those controls to change their appearance, and you can also show() and hide() them if they should not be shown in some circumstances.

		/** Header spans are a second level of headers that appear above the normal ListGrid headers, spanning one or more listGrid fields in a manner similar to a column-spanning cell in an HTML table. A header span can be created by simply naming the fields the header should span. The example below creates a headerSpan that spans the first two fields of the ListGrid. isc.ListGrid.create({ headerHeight:40, fields : [ { name:"field1" }, { name:"field2" }, { name:"field3" } ], headerSpans : [ { fields: ["field1", "field2"], title: "Field 1 and 2" } ] }); Header spans can be nested, allowing fields to be grouped by multiple levels of granularity. See HeaderSpan.spans for further information on nesting spans. Header spans will automatically react to resizing of the headers they span, and will be hidden automatically when all of the spanned fields are hidden. Header spans appear in the ListGrid.header','header area of the ListGrid, sharing space with the existing headers, so it's typical to set ListGrid.headerHeight to approximately double its normal height when using headerSpans, or if using nested header spans, the default header height multiplied by the number of levels of header spans to be shown. See HeaderSpan for many properties that allow the control of the appearance of headerSpans. Note that headerSpans are created via the AutoChild pattern, hence you can change the SmartClient component being used, or any of its properties. Neither headerSpans themselves nor the fields within them may be drag reordered, but other unspanned headers may be. A span can only span adjacent fields - if a span is defined and the spanned fields don't sit next to each other in the specified fields array, the fields array will be automatically reordered to match the order specified in the span's HeaderSpan.fields array. Note that headerSpans primarily provide a visual cue for grouping multiple headers together. If you have an OLAP, data "cube" or multi-dimensional data model, the CubeGrid component is the right choice.

See also ListGrid.allowFilterOperators for a UI that allows end users to change the search operator on the fly Note that if ListGrid.filterData or ListGrid.fetchData is called directly while the filter editor is showing, the filter editor values will be updated to reflect the new set of criteria. If you wish to retain the user entered filter criteria and modify a subset of field values programmatically, this can be achieved by copying the existing set of criteria and adding other changes - something like this: var newCriteria = myListGrid.getFilterEditorCriteria(); isc.DataSource.combineCriteria(newCriteria, { field1:"new value1", field2:"new value2" }); myListGrid.setCriteria(newCriteria); In this example code we're using ListGrid.getFilterEditorCriteria rather than ListGrid.getCriteria - this ensures that if the user has typed a new value into the filter editor, but not yet clicked the filter button, we pick up the value the user entered. This sample code uses DataSource.combineCriteria to combine the existing filterEditorCriteria with some new custom criteria. This technique is applicable to both simple and advanced criteria. If you call filterData() and pass in criteria for dataSource fields that are not present in the ListGrid, these criteria will continue to be applied along with the user-visible criteria. filterEditor and advanced criteria: If a developer calls filterData() on a ListGrid and passes in AdvancedCriteria, expected behavior of the filter editor becomes ambiguous, since AdvancedCriteria has far more complex filter expression support than the ordinary filterEditor can represent.

If the user enters values in the filter editor, these will be combined with the existing AdvancedCriteria by either replacing or adding field level criteria at the top level. If the top level criteria is a single field-criteria: If the field shows up in the listGrid and is canFilter:true, it will be displayed to the user (if the operator matches the default filter behavior for the field). If the user enters new filter criteria in the filterEditor, they will be combined with this existing criterion via a top level "and" operator, or if the user modifies the field for which the criterion already existed, it will be replaced. Otherwise, if there are multiple top level criteria combined with an "or" operator, these will not be shown in the filter editor. Any filter parameters the user enters will be added to the existing criteria via an additional top level "and" operator, meaning the user will essentially filter a subset of the existing criteria

Depending on the ListGrid.showRecordComponentsByCell setting, createRecordComponent() will be called either once per row, or once for every cell. Depending on ListGrid.recordComponentPosition, components can either be placed underneath normal record or cell content ("expand" setting) or placed so that they overlap normal cell content ("within" setting). For the "within" setting, the default is to fill the row or cell, but the component can specify percent size or even use Canvas.snapTo','snapTo-positioning to place itself within the row or cell.

Before using this subsystem: consider using ListGridField.valueIcons (possibly with a specified ListGridField.valueIconClick handler) for icons based on field values which may be displayed alone in the cell or alongside standard content (see ListGridField.showValueIconOnly); for clickable icons representing actions that can be taken on a record, also consider using ListGridFieldType','a field of type "icon", or multiple such fields for controls that only need to appear on rollover, consider ListGrid.showRollOverCanvas','rollOver controls if you are trying to customize the editor for a field, you can provide a custom control via ListGridField.editorType, and FormItem.icons are a common way to add clickable buttons.

This can be used to dynamically show controls or informational displays only on rollover. For example, controls to delete a row might appear only on rollover so they do not clutter the static display, or a "rollUnder" Canvas could be used to display additional information that can appear behind normal cell values (like displaying percent complete via as a bar of color that appears behind text values). Canvas.snapTo','snapTo positioning can be used to place the rollOver/rollUnderCanvas. With useCellRollOvers, positioning is relative to the cell, for row-level rollOver, position is relative to the portion of the row that is scrolled into view (this implies a row-level rollOver/UnderCanvas can never be placed horizontally scrolled out of view, but this is possible for a cell-level rollOver). snapTo positioning makes it easy to do something like place a button at the right edge of the grid, next to the scrollbar: just set snapTo:"R" on the rollOverCanvas. The rollOver/rollUnder Canvas can be a single static component (the same for all cells/rows) configured via the AutoChild system, or can instead be provided dynamically by implementing ListGrid.getRollOverCanvas and/or ListGrid.getRollUnderCanvas. The rollOver/rollUnder canvas will be automatically added to the grid's ListGrid.body','body as an ListGrid.addEmbeddedComponent','embedded component.

The default value of gridComponents is an Array of ListGridComponents listing the standard components in their default order: gridComponents : ["filterEditor", "header", "body", "summaryRow"] You can override gridComponents to change the order of standard components. You can also omit standard components this way, although it more efficient to use the related "show" property if available (eg ListGrid.showFilterEditor). Note that this array must contain an entry for the "body" - listGrids with no body showing are unsupported. Advanced note: The live components generated for each of these standard ListGridComponent types may differ across different listGrids. For example if this grid has any ListGridField.frozen','frozen fields, the "body" entry will actually be created as an HLayout containing two GridRenderers (one for frozen fields, and one for unfrozen fields).

Note that having added controls to gridComponents, you can still call APIs directly on those controls to change their appearance, and you can also show() and hide() them if they should not be shown in some circumstances.

		/** Header spans are a second level of headers that appear above the normal ListGrid headers, spanning one or more listGrid fields in a manner similar to a column-spanning cell in an HTML table.

The example below creates a headerSpan that spans the first two fields of the ListGrid. isc.ListGrid.create({ headerHeight:40, fields : [ { name:"field1" }, { name:"field2" }, { name:"field3" } ], headerSpans : [ { fields: ["field1", "field2"], title: "Field 1 and 2" } ] }); Header spans can be nested, allowing fields to be grouped by multiple levels of granularity. See HeaderSpan.spans for further information on nesting spans. Header spans will automatically react to resizing of the headers they span, and will be hidden automatically when all of the spanned fields are hidden. Header spans appear in the ListGrid.header','header area of the ListGrid, sharing space with the existing headers, so it's typical to set ListGrid.headerHeight to approximately double its normal height when using headerSpans, or if using nested header spans, the default header height multiplied by the number of levels of header spans to be shown. See HeaderSpan for many properties that allow the control of the appearance of headerSpans. Note that headerSpans are created via the AutoChild pattern, hence you can change the SmartClient component being used, or any of its properties. Neither headerSpans themselves nor the fields within them may be drag reordered, but other unspanned headers may be. A span can only span adjacent fields - if a span is defined and the spanned fields don't sit next to each other in the specified fields array, the fields array will be automatically reordered to match the order specified in the span's HeaderSpan.fields array. Note that headerSpans primarily provide a visual cue for grouping multiple headers together. If you have an OLAP, data "cube" or multi-dimensional data model, the CubeGrid component is the right choice.

ListGrid.autoFetchTextMatchStyle determines the textMatchStyle for the request passed to ListGrid.fetchData. The default FormItem.operator','search operator for an item in the filterEditor can be set via ListGridField.filterOperator. When field.filterOperator has been set calls to retrieve the criteria from the grid return AdvancedCriteria. See also ListGrid.allowFilterOperators for a UI that allows end users to change the search operator on the fly Note that if ListGrid.filterData or ListGrid.fetchData is called directly while the filter editor is showing, the filter editor values will be updated to reflect the new set of criteria. If you wish to retain the user entered filter criteria and modify a subset of field values programmatically, this can be achieved by copying the existing set of criteria and adding other changes - something like this: var newCriteria = myListGrid.getFilterEditorCriteria(); isc.DataSource.combineCriteria(newCriteria, { field1:"new value1", field2:"new value2" }); myListGrid.setCriteria(newCriteria); In this example code we're using ListGrid.getFilterEditorCriteria rather than ListGrid.getCriteria - this ensures that if the user has typed a new value into the filter editor, but not yet clicked the filter button, we pick up the value the user entered. This sample code uses DataSource.combineCriteria to combine the existing filterEditorCriteria with some new custom criteria. This technique is applicable to both simple and advanced criteria. If you call filterData() and pass in criteria for dataSource fields that are not present in the ListGrid, these criteria will continue to be applied along with the user-visible criteria. filterEditor and advanced criteria: If a developer calls filterData() on a ListGrid and passes in AdvancedCriteria, expected behavior of the filter editor becomes ambiguous, since AdvancedCriteria has far more complex filter expression support than the ordinary filterEditor can represent. Default behavior for AdvancedCriteria will combine the AdvancedCriteria with the values in the filter editor as follows: If the top level criteria has operator of type "and": Each field in the top level criteria array for which a 'canFilter' true field is shown in the listGrid will show up if the specified operator matches the default filter behavior (based on the ListGrid.autoFetchTextMatchStyle). If the user enters values in the filter editor, these will be combined with the existing AdvancedCriteria by either replacing or adding field level criteria at the top level. If the top level criteria is a single field-criteria: If the field shows up in the listGrid and is canFilter:true, it will be displayed to the user (if the operator matches the default filter behavior for the field). If the user enters new filter criteria in the filterEditor, they will be combined with this existing criterion via a top level "and" operator, or if the user modifies the field for which the criterion already existed, it will be replaced. Otherwise, if there are multiple top level criteria combined with an "or" operator, these will not be shown in the filter editor. Any filter parameters the user enters will be added to the existing criteria via an additional top level "and" operator, meaning the user will essentially filter a subset of the existing criteria

This can be used to dynamically show controls or informational displays only on rollover. For example, controls to delete a row might appear only on rollover so they do not clutter the static display, or a "rollUnder" Canvas could be used to display additional information that can appear behind normal cell values (like displaying percent complete via as a bar of color that appears behind text values). Canvas.snapTo','snapTo positioning can be used to place the rollOver/rollUnderCanvas. With useCellRollOvers, positioning is relative to the cell, for row-level rollOver, position is relative to the portion of the row that is scrolled into view (this implies a row-level rollOver/UnderCanvas can never be placed horizontally scrolled out of view, but this is possible for a cell-level rollOver). snapTo positioning makes it easy to do something like place a button at the right edge of the grid, next to the scrollbar: just set snapTo:"R" on the rollOverCanvas. The rollOver/rollUnder Canvas can be a single static component (the same for all cells/rows) configured via the AutoChild system, or can instead be provided dynamically by implementing ListGrid.getRollOverCanvas and/or ListGrid.getRollUnderCanvas.

	/**
	 * A Mail object describes an email that will be sent automatically by the SmartClient Server as part of a normal DataSource operation. Mail definitions are part of an OperationBinding, and they can only be specified in a DataSource's XML definition. Despite the declarative nature of mail definitions, templating support via Velocity makes it very flexible; it is very easy to include values from records just fetched from permanent storage by this operation, for example. See velocitySupport for an overview of SmartClient Server's pervasive support for templated declarative operations using Velocity. The default context for the message is the dsResponse.data; that is, $foo in the message refers to the field "foo" in the DataSource response (the equivalent of calling dsResponse.getFieldValue("foo") in Java). You also have access to the normal Velocity variables described in the overview linked to above. If multiple records appear in the dsResponse, one message will be sent per record in the response unless "multiple" is set to false. This allows a set of recipients to be selected by a "fetch" operationBinding and messages sent to each. This also means that if no data is selected by a fetch or affected by an update, no mail is sent. If you have the transactionChaining','Transaction Chaining feature (available in Power and better versions), all of the variables normally accessible in other Velocity contexts are available in the message template as well, for example: $responseData.last('order').orderId You can provide the body of the email directly in the Mail.messageTemplate','messageTemplate tag, or you can provide a filename in the Mail.templateFile','templateFile attribute, which tells SmartClient to use the contents of that file as the body of the email. If you provide neither of these, your email will have no body; if you provide both, SmartClient will ignore the file and just use the content directly provided. Mail server configuration The mail server to use for sending emails is configured in the server_properties','server.properties file. The following values can be provided: mail.system.mail.smtp.host: The name of the SMTP server to use; defaults to "localhost" mail.system.mail.smtp.port: What port is the MTA listening on; defaults to 25 mail.system.mail.smtp.auth: Whether this server requires authentication; defaults to false mail.system.mail.smtp.user: SMTP user, if authentication is on; no default mail.system.mail.smtp.password: Password, if authentication is on; no default Note that we will also pass any other properties that start mail.system through to the underlying Javamail Session object, so you can use Javamail features that aren't explicitly exposed by SmartClient's mail support. For example, many cloud-based SMTP providers require that you issue a STARTTLS command before authenticating; you can achieve this by adding the following line to server_properties','server.properties: mail.system.mail.smtp.starttls.enable: true

For any other setting of operator, the criteria is first converted to the equivalent AdvancedCriteria and then processed as described below AdvancedCriteria: If the topmost operator is "and", we add the new criterion as an additional criterion directly in the existing list. Otherwise, we create a new top-level AdvancedCriteria with an operator of "and". This is then set to have two elements in its criteria: the previous top-level criteria and the new criterion. The effect of this is to apply any criteria specifed here as additional constraints on top of what the user has specified, and of course, the user is unable to affect this. Thus, this is a suitable and convenient place to enforce rules such as "Users can only ever see their own records". Below is an example of the XML as it should be defined in your ds.xml, datasource definitions. &lt;operationBindings&gt; &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" operationId="..."&gt; &lt;criteria fieldName="USER_ROLE" value="ADMIN" operator="equals" /&gt; &lt;/operationBinding&gt; &lt;/operationBindings&gt;

If set this denotes a "super user" role - any user with that role will have access to all operations, regardless of the "requiresRole" settings for the operation. Whether the current user has a given role is determined by calling the standard Java servlets method httpServletRequest.isUserInRole(), hence works with both simple J2EE security (realms and form-based authentication) and JAAS (Java Authentication & Authorization Service). If you wish to use a role-based security scheme that does not make use of the servlet API's standards, SmartClient Server also implements the setAuthenticated and setUserRoles methods on RPCManager. You can use this API to tell SmartClient that all the requests in the queue currently being processed are associated with a user who has the roles you supply; in this case, SmartClient will not attempt to resolve the user's roles via httpServletRequest.isUserInRole(). When taking this approach, the rpcManager.setUserRoles() method should be called on the server for each transaction received from the client. We recommend doing this by overriding the special IDACall servlet and checking server side state to determine the current user's roles, calling the API, and then calling handleDSRequest() or handleRPCRequest() directly to handle the request(s) passed in. Here's an example of this approach which assumes the current user's roles has been set directly on the HttpSession object as a comma-separated-string attribute "roles": public class SecureIDACall extends IDACall { public void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { HttpSession session = request.getSession(); Object roles = session == null ? null : session.getAttribute("roles"); if (roles != null) { try { RequestContext context = RequestContext.instance(this, request, response); RPCManager rpc = new RPCManager(request, response); rpc.setAuthenticated(true); rpc.setUserRoles((String) roles); // call processRPCTransaction() to iterate through all RPCRequests and // DSRequests and execute them processRPCTransaction(rpc, context); } catch (Throwable e) { handleError(response, e); } } else { super.processRequest(request, response); } } } If there is an operationBinding declared for a given operationType which does not have an OperationBinding.operationId, that is, it is the default operationBinding for the type, then any other operationBinding of the same type is assumed to have the same setting for requiresRole as the default operationBinding for the operationType. For example, given these declarations: &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" requiresRole="manager"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" operationId="fetchWithExtraFields"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; The second operationBinding requires the "manager" role even though there is no explicit requiresRole declaration. To prevent the "manager" role being required by the second operationBinding, add requireRole="". Note that if DataSource.requiresRole is set, all operations on the DataSource require the roles set for the DataSource as a whole, even if they declare individual requiresRole attributes. This property is valid only for a server-side DataSource when using the SmartClient Server. <h3>Special rules for cache sync</h3> After successfull "add" or "update" operation cache sync request is performed, which is using "fetch" operation of the same datasource. It may happen that user is allowed to add records, but is not allowed to fetch them, for example: &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" requiresRole="admin"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; &lt;operationBinding operationType="add"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; User without "admin" role will be able to successfully add record, but the cache sync operation will fail due to security violation. In this case the record will be saved to database, but the added record will not be fetched from database, instead just DSRequest.oldValues','old values overlaid with submitted values will be returned. So, any changes made to the new record during request execution, including generated values for primary key fields of "sequence" type, will not be returned to the client. However, if "add" or "update" operation explicitly declares OperationBinding.cacheSyncOperation, cache sync request will be executed even if the user does not meet the security checks for the operationBinding. Note that field-level security still will be respected and disallowed fields will be excluded from returned data.

If set this denotes a "super user" role - any user with that role will have access to all operations, regardless of the "requiresRole" settings for the operation. Whether the current user has a given role is determined by calling the standard Java servlets method httpServletRequest.isUserInRole(), hence works with both simple J2EE security (realms and form-based authentication) and JAAS (Java Authentication & Authorization Service). If you wish to use a role-based security scheme that does not make use of the servlet API's standards, SmartClient Server also implements the setAuthenticated and setUserRoles methods on RPCManager. You can use this API to tell SmartClient that all the requests in the queue currently being processed are associated with a user who has the roles you supply; in this case, SmartClient will not attempt to resolve the user's roles via httpServletRequest.isUserInRole(). When taking this approach, the rpcManager.setUserRoles() method should be called on the server for each transaction received from the client. We recommend doing this by overriding the special IDACall servlet and checking server side state to determine the current user's roles, calling the API, and then calling handleDSRequest() or handleRPCRequest() directly to handle the request(s) passed in. Here's an example of this approach which assumes the current user's roles has been set directly on the HttpSession object as a comma-separated-string attribute "roles": public class SecureIDACall extends IDACall { public void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { HttpSession session = request.getSession(); Object roles = session == null ? null : session.getAttribute("roles"); if (roles != null) { try { RequestContext context = RequestContext.instance(this, request, response); RPCManager rpc = new RPCManager(request, response); rpc.setAuthenticated(true); rpc.setUserRoles((String) roles); // call processRPCTransaction() to iterate through all RPCRequests and // DSRequests and execute them processRPCTransaction(rpc, context); } catch (Throwable e) { handleError(response, e); } } else { super.processRequest(request, response); } } } If there is an operationBinding declared for a given operationType which does not have an OperationBinding.operationId, that is, it is the default operationBinding for the type, then any other operationBinding of the same type is assumed to have the same setting for requiresRole as the default operationBinding for the operationType. For example, given these declarations: &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" requiresRole="manager"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" operationId="fetchWithExtraFields"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; The second operationBinding requires the "manager" role even though there is no explicit requiresRole declaration. To prevent the "manager" role being required by the second operationBinding, add requireRole="". Note that if DataSource.requiresRole is set, all operations on the DataSource require the roles set for the DataSource as a whole, even if they declare individual requiresRole attributes. This property is valid only for a server-side DataSource when using the SmartClient Server. <h3>Special rules for cache sync</h3> After successfull "add" or "update" operation cache sync request is performed, which is using "fetch" operation of the same datasource. It may happen that user is allowed to add records, but is not allowed to fetch them, for example: &lt;operationBinding operationType="fetch" requiresRole="admin"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; &lt;operationBinding operationType="add"&gt; ... settings ... &lt;/operationBinding&gt; User without "admin" role will be able to successfully add record, but the cache sync operation will fail due to security violation. In this case the record will be saved to database, but the added record will not be fetched from database, instead just DSRequest.oldValues','old values overlaid with submitted values will be returned. So, any changes made to the new record during request execution, including generated values for primary key fields of "sequence" type, will not be returned to the client. However, if "add" or "update" operation explicitly declares OperationBinding.cacheSyncOperation, cache sync request will be executed even if the user does not meet the security checks for the operationBinding. Note that field-level security still will be respected and disallowed fields will be excluded from returned data.

	/**
	 * The RestDataSource implements the 4 core DataSource operations using a simple protocol of XML or JSON requests and responses sent over HTTP, which can be easily fulfilled by any HTTP server technology. RestDataSource is named for the <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=REST+HTTP' target='_blank'>REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) pattern, which in brief says that simple messages passed over HTTP is a sufficient protocol for many web applications, without the need for further protocols such as WSDL or SOAP. A RestDataSource is used just like a normal DataSource. RestDataSources are pre-configured, using the general-purpose databinding facilities of DataSources, to expect a particular format for responses and to send requests in a specific format. These request and response formats represent Isomorphic's recommended best practices for binding SmartClient to backends which do not already support a similar, pre-existing request and response format and where the SmartClient Java Server cannot be used. If you have a pre-existing REST or WSDL service which is difficult to change, consider adapting SmartClient to the existing service instead, by starting with a normal DataSource and using the clientDataIntegration','client-side data integration facilities to create a mapping between SmartClient's DSRequest and DSResponse objects and the message formats of your existing services. NOTE: do not begin this process by creating or subclassing RestDataSource; for a pre-existing service which is unrelated to the protocol documented for RestDataSource, start by configuring or subclassing DataSource instead. RestDataSource is typically used with PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl or custom server technologies, and represents an alternative to installing the SmartClient Server in a Java technology stack, or using wsdlBinding','WSDL-based binding with .NET or other WSDL-capable technologies. Note that SmartClient Server also provides built-in support for the REST protocol via its RESTHandler servlet; this is primarily to allow non-SmartClient clients to make use of DataSource operations. If you particularly wished to do so, you could use RestDataSource to make a SmartClient app talk to the SmartClient Server using REST rather than the proprietary wire format normally used when communicating with SmartClient Server (this is how we are able to write automated tests for the RESTHandler servlet). However, doing this provides no benefit, imposes a number of inconveniences, and makes a handful of server-based features less useful (DataSourceField.viewRequiresAuthentication','field-level declarative security, for example), so we strongly recommend that you do <em>not</em> do this; it is only mentioned here for completeness while we are discussing REST. The request and response formats used by the RestDataSource allow for many of the available features of SmartClient's databinding system to be used, including data paging, searching & sorting, DSRequest.oldValues','long transactions, ResultSet','automatic cache sync, relogin','relogin and RPCManager.startQueue','queuing. However, advanced features such as upload','uploading / binary fields and ListGrid.exportData','export aren't available with RestDataSource and need to be re-implemented as needed. Most, though not all, iscServer','server-based features are still available when using RestDataSource, as long as you are also using the RESTHandler servlet that is part of SmartClient Server. However, as noted above, this approach is not recommended; if you are using Isomorphic technology both client- and server-side, it makes more sense to use the proprietary wire format. RestDataSource and binary data Binary data in a response provided to a RestDataSource must be delivered as valid XML or JSON Strings. Once delivered to the browser as Strings, there is no way to trigger the browser's "Save As" dialog to download the data, and in most cases no way to trigger other helper applications that might be launched to handle binary data (such as Excel or a PDF viewer). Hence for binary it usually makes sense to make a direct request via RPCManager.sendRequest() with downloadResult:true, separate from RestDataSource. If you are using the SmartClient Server included in Pro, Power end Enterprise to handle your REST requests server-side, there is transparent support for conversion between Java InputStreams representing binary data, and Strings containing that binary data encoded using the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>Base64 algorithm</a>. Thus, on the server, the binary data is in its raw binary form, with transparent conversion to or from Base64 for messages to or from the REST client. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Examples</span> XML formatted responses: RestDataSource expects a response like the following in response to a "fetch" request: &lt;response&gt; &lt;status&gt;0&lt;/status&gt; &lt;startRow&gt;0&lt;/startRow&gt; &lt;endRow&gt;76&lt;/endRow&gt; &lt;totalRows&gt;546&lt;/totalRows&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;record&gt; &lt;field1&gt;value&lt;/field1&gt; &lt;field2&gt;value&lt;/field2&gt; &lt;/record&gt; &lt;record&gt; &lt;field1&gt;value&lt;/field1&gt; &lt;field2&gt;value&lt;/field2&gt; &lt;/record&gt; ... 76 total records ... &lt;/data&gt; &lt;/response&gt; The &lt;status&gt; element indicates whether the fetch operation was successful (see statusCodes). The &lt;data&gt; element contains a list of record nodes, each of which represents a record returned by the server. The optional &lt;startRow&gt;, &lt;endRow&gt; and &lt;totalRows&gt; elements are needed only if data paging is in use, and populate the DSResponse.startRow','startRow, DSResponse.endRow','endRow and DSResponse.totalRows','totalRows properties of the DSResponse. Note: for a more compact format, simple field values may be specified on record nodes directly as attributes - in this case a record element might be structured like this: &lt;record field1="value" field2="value" /&gt; Note that a RestDataSource will bypass browser caching of all responses by default. See DataSource.preventHTTPCaching. Successful "add" or "update" request responses are similar in format - in this case the data element would be expected to contain a single record object containing the details of the record, as saved on the server. The response from a "remove" operation would again include status and data elements, but in this case, only the primary key field value(s) of the removed record would be expected to be present under the data element. If a validation failure occurred on the server, the response would have status set to RPCResponse.STATUS_VALIDATION_ERROR [-4], and any validation errors could be included as per-field sub-elements of an "errors" element. For a validation error, the response is not expected to contain any &lt;data&gt; element. A response showing a validation error might look like this: &lt;response&gt; &lt;status&gt;-4&lt;/status&gt; &lt;errors&gt; &lt;field1&gt; &lt;errorMessage&gt;A validation error occurred for this field&lt;/errorMessage&gt; &lt;/field1&gt; &lt;/errors&gt; &lt;/response&gt; An unrecoverable error, such as an unexpected server failure, can be flagged by setting &lt;status&gt; to -1 and setting &lt;data&gt; to an error message. In this case the &lt;errors&gt; element is not used (it's specific to validation errors). An unrecoverable error causes all response processing to be skipped and RPCManager.handleError to be invoked, which by default will show the provided error message as an alert using isc.warn. JSON formatted responses: JSON format responses are expected to contain the same data / meta-data as XMLresponses, encapsulated in a simple object with a "response" attribute. The response to a "fetch" request would therefore have this format: { "response": { "status": 0, "startRow": 0, "endRow": 76, "totalRows": 546, "data": [ {"field1": "value", "field2": "value"}, {"field1": "value", "field2": "value"}, ... 76 total records ... ] } } The structure successful for "add", "update" and "remove" responses would be similar, though the data array would be expected to contain only a single object, representing the values as saved. This allows the server to return values such as an auto-generated sequence primaryKey, a last modified timestamp, or similar server-generated field values. For a remove, only the value for the primaryKey field[s] would be required. For a validation error, the status attribute would be set to RPCResponse.STATUS_VALIDATION_ERROR [-4], and errors would be specified in the errors attribute of the response. For example: { "response": { "status": -4, "errors": { "field1": {"errorMessage": "A validation error on field1"}, "field2": {"errorMessage": "A validation error on field2"} } } } An array of errors may also be returned for a single field, like this: { "response": { "status": -4, "errors": { "field1": [ {"errorMessage": "First error on field1"}, {"errorMessage": "Second error on field1"} ] } } } As with the XML format above, an unrecoverable error is indicated by setting the status attribute to -1 and the data property to the error message. Server inbound data formats The format of data sent to the server is determined by the OperationBinding.dataProtocol specified for the operation. Request data is sent as parameters if the format is specified as "getParams" or "postParams". In this case, the parameters sent to the server will consist of the DSRequest's data, and any parameters explicitly specified on the DSRequest object (as RPCRequest.params. If RestDataSource.sendMetaData is true, the DSRequest meta data properties will also be present as parameters, prefixed with RestDataSource.metaDataPrefix. Example URL constructed with the metaDataPrefix set to "_" (the default): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[dataURL]?field1=value1&_operationType=fetch&_startRow=0&_endRow=50&_sortBy=-field2&_dataSource=dsName In this case the server would be able to separate the request's data from the meta data via the "_" prefix. If data is sent to the server via the "postMessage" dataProtocol, the data will be serialized as an XML or JSON message according to the dataFormat setting. Both XML and JSON messages will contain request metadata such as startRow and endRow, and will appear exactly as though the subset of the DSRequest that is meaningful to the server had been passed to DataSource.xmlSerialize or JSON.encode respectively. An example of an XML message might look like this: &lt;request&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;countryCode&gt;US&lt;/countryCode&gt; &lt;countryName&gt;Edited Value&lt;/countryName&gt; &lt;capital&gt;Edited Value&lt;/capital&gt; &lt;continent&gt;Edited Value&lt;/continent&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;dataSource&gt;countryDS&lt;/dataSource&gt; &lt;operationType&gt;update&lt;/operationType&gt; &lt/request&gt; An example of an XML message for a fetch operation passing simple criteria: &lt;request&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;continent&gt;North America&lt;/continent&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;dataSource&gt;countryDS&lt;/dataSource&gt; &lt;operationType&gt;fetch&lt;/operationType&gt; &lt;startRow&gt;0&lt;/startRow&gt; &lt;endRow&gt;75&lt;/endRow&gt; &lt;componentId&gt;worldGrid&lt;/componentId&gt; &lt;textMatchStyle&gt;exact&lt;/textMatchStyle&gt; &lt/request&gt; And an example of an XML message for a fetch operation passing AdvancedCriteria: &lt;request&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;_constructor&gt;AdvancedCriteria&lt;/_constructor&gt; &lt;operator&gt;or&lt;/operator&gt; &lt;criteria&gt; &lt;criterion&gt; &lt;fieldName&gt;continent&lt;/fieldName&gt; &lt;operator&gt;equals&lt;/operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;North America&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/criterion&gt; &lt;criterion&gt; &lt;operator&gt;and&lt;/operator&gt; &lt;criteria&gt; &lt;criterion&gt; &lt;fieldName&gt;continent&lt;/fieldName&gt; &lt;operator&gt;equals&lt;/operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;Europe&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/criterion&gt; &lt;criterion&gt; &lt;fieldName&gt;population&lt;/fieldName&gt; &lt;operator&gt;greaterThan&lt;/operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;50000000&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/criterion&gt; &lt;/criteria&gt; &lt;/criterion&gt; &lt;/criteria&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;dataSource&gt;countryDS&lt;/dataSource&gt; &lt;operationType&gt;fetch&lt;/operationType&gt; &lt;startRow&gt;0&lt;/startRow&gt; &lt;endRow&gt;75&lt;/endRow&gt; &lt;componentId&gt;worldGrid&lt;/componentId&gt; &lt/request&gt; An example of an XML message for a fetch operation when using serverSummaries','server-side summaries: &lt;request&gt; &lt;data&gt;&lt;/data&gt; &lt;dataSource&gt;countryDS&lt;/dataSource&gt; &lt;operationType&gt;fetch&lt;/operationType&gt; &lt;summaryFunctions&gt; &lt;pk&gt;count&lt;/pk&gt; &lt;/summaryFunctions&gt; &lt;groupBy&gt;member_g8&lt;/groupBy&gt; &lt/request&gt; JSON messages are just the plain JSON form of the structures shown in the above XML examples. The advanced criteria XML example above but in JSON form: { data: { _constructor: "AdvancedCriteria", operator: "or", criteria: [ { fieldName: "continent", operator: "equals", value: "North America }, { operator: "and", criteria: [ { fieldName: "continent", operator: "equals", value: "Europe" }, { fieldName: "population", operator: "greaterThan", value: 50000000 } ] } ] } dataSource: "countryDS", operationType: "fetch", startRow: 0, endRow: 75, componentId: "worldGrid" } The RestDataSource.operationBindings','default OperationBindings for a RestDataSource specify dataProtocol as "getParams" for the fetch operation, and "postParams" for update, add and remove operations. Note that most webservers impose a limit on the maximum size of GET requests (specifically, on the size of the request URL + HTTP headers). Using dataProtocol:"getParams" for "fetch" operations that involve complex AdvancedCriteria will result in a JSON serialization of the AdvancedCriteria in the request URL, and when combined with large cookies this can easily overflow the default limits on certain webservers (see <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/686217/maximum-on-http-header-values' target='_blank'>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/686217/maximum-on-http-header-values</a>). For this reason, we recommend that you use the "postMessage" protocol whenever you are intending to use AdvancedCriteria with RestDataSource. Date, time and datetime values Date, time and datetime values must be communicated using XML Schema format, as in the following examples: &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dateField&gt;2007-04-22&lt;/dateField&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;timeField&gt;11:07:13&lt;/timeField&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dateTimeField&gt;2007-04-22T11:07:13&lt;/dateTimeField&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dateTimeField&gt;2007-04-22T11:07:13.582&lt;/dateTimeField&gt; And the equivalent in JSON: &nbsp;&nbsp;dateField: "2007-04-22" &nbsp;&nbsp;timeField: "11:07:13" &nbsp;&nbsp;dateTimeField: "2007-04-22T11:07:13" &nbsp;&nbsp;dateTimeField: "2007-04-22T11:07:13.582" Both RestDataSource on the client-side and the RESTHandler servlet on the server side automatically handle encoding and decoding temporal values using these formats. Both also handle datetime formats including or excluding milliseconds automatically. When encoding, both honor the DataSource.trimMilliseconds setting on the DataSource, falling back to the server.properties setting rest.trimMilliseconds; when decoding, both detect whether or not to try to parse milliseconds based on the string they receive. Fields of type "date" and "time" are considered to hold logical date and time values, as discussed in the dateFormatAndStorage','date and time handling article, and are not affected by timezones. Fields of type "datetime" will be converted to UTC on the client side by RestDataSource, and will be sent back down to the client as UTC by the server-side RESTHandler. We recommend that your own REST client and/or server code do the same thing (ie, transmit all datetime values in both directions as UTC). Note that the examples given above give no timezone information, and will be treated by the SmartClient Server as UTC values. If you wish to work with datetime values in a particular timezone, use a format like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dateField&gt;2007-04-22T11:07:13-0800&lt;/dateField&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dateField&gt;2012-11-19T22:12:04+0100&lt;/dateField&gt; And the equivalent in JSON: &nbsp;&nbsp;dateTimeField: "2007-04-22T11:07:13-0800" &nbsp;&nbsp;dateTimeField: "2012-11-19T22:12:04+0100" NOTE: Although we refer above to XML Schema format, the format used for specifying timezone offset is slightly different from XML Schema - as shown in the above examples, you specify "+HHMM" or "-HHMM", as opposed to the XML Schema format which requires a ":" character between the hours and minutes. The reason for this difference is simply that the Java SimpleDateFormat class imposes it. RestDataSource queuing support RestDataSource supports RPCManager.startQueue','queuing of DSRequests. This allows you to send multiple requests to the server in a single HTTP turnaround, thus minimizing network traffic and allowing the server to treat multiple requests as a single transaction, if the server is able to do so (in Power Edition and above, the SmartClient Server transparently supports grouping multiple REST requests in a queue into a single database transaction when using one of the built-in DataSource types). Note that you can disable queuing support with the RestDataSource.disableQueuing flag. If you want to use queuing with RestDataSource, you must use the "postMessage" dataProtocol with either XML or JSON dataFormat. Message format is similar to the non-queued examples shown earlier: it is simply extended to cope with the idea of multiple DSRequests encapsulated in the message. An example of the XML message sent from RestDataSource to the server for two update requests combined into a queue, using XML dataFormat: &lt;transaction&gt; &lt;operations&gt; &lt;request&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;pk&gt;1&lt;/pk&gt; &lt;countryName&gt;Edited Value&lt;/countryName&gt; &lt;capital&gt;Edited Value&lt;/capital&gt; &lt;continent&gt;Edited Value&lt;/continent&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;dataSource&gt;countryDS&lt;/dataSource&gt; &lt;operationType&gt;update&lt;/operationType&gt; &lt/request&gt; &lt;request&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;pk&gt;2&lt;/pk&gt; &lt;capital&gt;Edited Value&lt;/capital&gt; &lt;population&gt;123456&lt;/population&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;dataSource&gt;countryDS&lt;/dataSource&gt; &lt;operationType&gt;update&lt;/operationType&gt; &lt/request&gt; &lt;/operations&gt; &lt;transaction&gt; And the same message in JSON format: { transaction: { operations: [{ dataSource:"countryDS", operationType:"update", data: { pk: 1 countryName: "Edited Value", capital: "Edited Value", continent: "Edited Value" } }, { dataSource:"countryDS", operationType:"update", data: { pk: 2, capital: "Edited Value", popuilation: 123456 } }] } } RestDataSource expects the response to a queue of requests to be a queue of responses in the same order as the original requests. Again, the message format is very similar to the unqueued REST format, it just has an outer container construct. Note also that the individual DSResponses in a queued response have an extra property, DSResponse.queueStatus','queueStatus. This allows each individual response to determine whether the queue as a whole succeeded. For example, if the first update succeeded but the second failed validation, the first response would have a status of 0, but a queueStatus of -1, while the second response would have both properties set to -1. The update queue example given above would expect a response like this (in XML): &lt;responses&gt; &lt;response&gt; &lt;status&gt;0&lt;/status&gt; &lt;queueStatus&gt;0&lt;/queueStatus&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;record&gt; &lt;countryName&gt;Edited Value&lt;/countryName&gt; &lt;gdp&gt;1700.0&lt;/gdp&gt; &lt;continent&gt;Edited Value&lt;/continent&gt; &lt;capital&gt;Edited Value&lt;/capital&gt; &lt;pk&gt;1&lt;/pk&gt; &lt;/record&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;/response&gt; &lt;response&gt; &lt;status&gt;0&lt;/status&gt; &lt;queueStatus&gt;0&lt;/queueStatus&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;record&gt; &lt;countryName&gt;United States&lt;/countryName&gt; &lt;gdp&gt;7247700.0&lt;/gdp&gt; &lt;continent&gt;North America&lt;/continent&gt; &lt;independence&gt;1776-07-04&lt;/independence&gt; &lt;capital&gt;Washington DC&lt;/capital&gt; &lt;pk&gt;2&lt;/pk&gt; &lt;population&gt;123456&lt;/population&gt; &lt;/record&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;/response&gt; &lt;/responses&gt; And in JSON: [ { "response": { "queueStatus": 0, "status": 0, "data": [{ "countryName": "Edited Value", "gdp": 1700.0, "continent": "Edited Value", "capital": "Edited Value", "pk": 1 }] } }, { "response": { "queueStatus": 0, "status": 0, "data": [{ "countryName": "United States", "gdp": 7247700.0, "continent": "North America", "independence": "1776-07-04", "capital": "Washington DC", "pk": 2, "population": 123456 }] } } ] Hierarchical (Tree) data: To create a hierarchical DataSource, in the DataSource's fields array, a field must be specified as the parent id field - the field which will contain a pointer to the id of each node's parent. This can be achieved by setting the DataSourceField.foreignKey and the DataSourceField.rootValue attributes on the field definition. For example: RestDataSource.create({ ID:"supplyItem", fields : [ {name:"itemId", type:"sequence", primaryKey:true}, {name:"parentId", type:"integer", foreignKey:"supplyItem.itemId", rootValue:0}, ... ] }); Tree Data is then treated on the server as a flat list of records linked by parent id. Tree data is typically displayed using a dataBound TreeGrid component. TreeGrids automatically create a ResultTree data object, which requests data directly from the DataSource. ResultTrees load data on demand, only requesting currently visible (open) nodes from the server. This is handled by including a specified value for the parent id field in the request criteria. To implement a standard load-on-demand tree RestDataSource back end, you should therefore simply return the set of nodes that match the criteria passed in. For example, if your DataSource was defined as the "supplyItem" code snippet above, a fetch request for all children of a node with itemId set to 12 would have "parentId" set to 12 in the request criteria. A valid response would then contain all the records that matched this criteria. For example: &lt;response&gt; &lt;status&gt;0&lt;/status&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;record&gt; &lt;itemId&gt;15&lt;/itemId&gt; &lt;parentId&gt;12&lt;/parentId&gt; &lt;/record&gt; &lt;record&gt; &lt;itemId&gt;16&lt;/itemId&gt; &lt;parentId&gt;12&lt;/parentId&gt; &lt;/record&gt; &lt;/data&gt; &lt;/response&gt; The structure of responses for Add, Update and Delete type requests will be the same regardless of whether the data is hierarchical. However you should be aware that the underlying data storage may need to be managed slightly differently in some cases. Specifically, Add and Update operations may change the structure of the tree by returning a new parent id field value for the modified node. Depending on how your data is stored you may need to include special back-end logic to handle this. Also, if a user deletes a folder within a databound tree, any children of that folder will also be dropped from the tree, and can be removed from the back-end data storage. Note: For a general overview of binding components to Tree structured data, see treeDataBinding','Tree Databinding.

	/**
	 * ResultSets are an implementation of the List interface that automatically fetches DataSource records when items are requested from the List. ResultSets provide robust, customizable, high-performance cache management for ListGrids and other built-in SmartClient components, and can be used as cache managers by custom components. ResultSets manage data paging, that is, loading records in batches as the user navigates the data set. A ResultSet will switch to using client-side sorting and filtering when possible to improve responsiveness and reduce server load. ResultSets also participate in automatic cache synchronization, observing operations on DataSources and automatically updating their caches. Creation A ResultSet can be passed to any component that expects a List, and the List APIs can be called directly on the ResultSet as long as the caller is able to deal with asynchronous loading; see ResultSet.getRange. Generally ResultSets do not need to be created directly, but are created by DataBound components as an automatic consequence of calling dataBoundComponentMethods','DataBound Component Methods. For example, the ListGrid.fetchData causes ListGrid.data to become an automatically created ResultSet object. Automatically created ResultSets can be customized via properties on ListGrids such as ListGrid.dataPageSize and ListGrid.dataProperties. All ResultSets for a given DataSource may also be customized via setting DataSource.resultSetClass to the name of a ResultSet isc.defineClass','subclass in which Class.addProperties','defaults have been changed. A ResultSet defaults to using data paging, setting DSRequest.startRow and DSRequest.endRow in issued dsRequests. Server code may always return more rows than the ResultSet requests and the ResultSet will correctly integrate those rows based on DSResponse.startRow/DSResponse.endRow','endRow. Hence the server can always avoid paging mode by simply returning all matching rows. A ResultSet can be created directly with just the ID of a DataSource: isc.ResultSet.create({ dataSource : "dataSourceID" }) Directly created ResultSets are typically used by custom components, or as a means of managing datasets that will be used by several components. When created directly rather than via a dataBoundComponent, a newly created ResultSet will not issue it's first "fetch" DSRequest until data is accessed (for example, via ResultSet.get','get()). Paging and total dataset length When using data paging, the server communicates the total number of records that match the current search criteria by setting DSResponse.totalRows. The ResultSet will then return this number from ResultSet.getLength','getLength(), and ListGrids and other components will show a scrollbar that allows the user to jump to the end of the dataset directly. However, the ResultSet does not require that the server calculate the true length of the dataset, which can be costly for an extremely large, searchable dataset. Instead, the server may simply advertise a totalRows value that is one page larger than the last row loaded. This results in a UI sometimes called "progressive loading", where the user may load more rows by scrolling past the end of the currently loaded rows, but is not allowed to skip to the end of the dataset. No client-side settings are required to enable this mode - it is entirely server-driven. However, it is usually coupled with ListGrid.canSort','disabling sorting, since server-side sorting would also force the server to traverse the entire dataset. Note also the DataSource.progressiveLoading','progressiveLoading flag, which can be applied at a DataSource, operation, request, component or ResultSet level; if you are using the built-in server-side DataSource implementations with Pro or better, this tells SmartClient Server to use its pre-built progressive loading mode for that DataSource, operation, request, component or ResultSet. Client-side Sorting and Filtering If a ResultSet obtains a full cache for the current set of filter criteria, it will automatically switch to client-side sorting, and will also use client-side filtering if the filter criteria are later changed but appear to be more restrictive than the criteria in use when the ResultSet obtained a full cache. The ResultSet.useClientSorting','useClientSorting and ResultSet.useClientFiltering','useClientFiltering flags can be used to disable client-side sorting and filtering respectively if these behaviors don't match server-based sorting and filtering. However, because client-side sorting and filtering radically improve responsiveness and reduce server load, it is better to customize the ResultSet so that it can match server-side sorting and filtering behaviors. Sorting behavior is primarily customized via the "sort normalizer" passed to ResultSet.sortByProperty, either via direct calls on a standalone ResultSet, or via ListGridField.sortNormalizer for a ListGrid-managed ResultSet. By default, client-side filtering interprets the Criteria','criteria passed to ResultSet.setCriteria','setCriteria() as a set of field values that records must match (similarly to the built-in SQL/Hibernate connectors built into the SmartClient Server). Custom client-side filtering logic can be implemented by overriding ResultSet.applyFilter','applyFilter(). Overriding ResultSet.compareCriteria','compareCriteria() allows you to control when the ResultSet uses client-side vs server-side filtering, and the ResultSet has two default ResultSet.criteriaPolicy','criteria policies built-in. Modifying ResultSets Records cannot be directly added or removed from a ResultSet via List APIs such as List.removeAt','removeAt(), since this would break the consistency of server and client row numbering needed for data paging, and also create some issues with automatic cache synchronization. Use DataSource.addData/DataSource.removeData','removeData() to add/remove rows from the DataSource, and the ResultSet will reflect the changes automatically. Alternatively, the DataSource.updateCaches method may be called to only update local caches of the DataSource in question, without generating any server traffic. To create a locally modifiable cache of Records from a DataSource, you can use DataSource.fetchData to retrieve a List of Records which can be modified directly, or you can create a client-only DataSource from the retrieved data to share a modifiable cache between several DataBoundComponents. Updates and Automatic Cache Synchronization Once a ResultSet has retrieved data or has been initialized with data, the ResultSet will observe any successful "update", "add" or "remove" dsRequests against their DataSource, regardless of the component that initiated them. A ResultSet with a full cache for the current filter criteria will integrate updates into the cache automatically. Updated rows that no longer match the current filter criteria will be removed automatically. To prevent this, you can set ResultSet.neverDropUpdatedRows. Added rows will similarly be added to the cache only if they match current filter criteria. Note that the client-side filtering described above is also used to determine whether updated or added rows should be in the cache. If any aspect of automated cache update is ever incorrect, ResultSet.dropCacheOnUpdate','dropCacheOnUpdate can be set for the ResultSet or DSResponse.invalidateCache can be set for an individual dsResponse. If automatic cache synchronization isn't working, troubleshoot the problem using the steps suggested <a href='http://forums.smartclient.com/showthread.php?t=8159#aGrid' target='_blank'>in the FAQ</a>. Regarding OperationBinding.operationId','operationIds and how they affect caching, take into account that cache sync is based on the fetch used - any add or update operation uses a fetch to retrieve updated data, and the operationId of that fetch can be set via OperationBinding.cacheSyncOperation','cacheSyncOperation. If the operationId of the cache is different from the operationId of the cache update data, it won't be used to update the cache, since the fields included and other aspects of the data are allowed to be different across different operationIds. This allows to maintain distinct caches on a per component basis, so when two components are using separate operationIds they are assumed to have distinct caches, because updates performed with one operationId will not affect the cache obtained via another operationId. Also, take into account that operationId must be unique per DataSource, across all operationTypes for that DataSource. Data Paging with partial cache When in paging mode with a partial cache, a ResultSet relies on server side sorting, setting DSRequest.sortBy to the current sort field and direction. In order for the cache to remain coherent, row numbering must continue to agree between server and client as new fetches are issued, otherwise, duplicate rows or missing rows may occur. If concurrent modifications by other users are allowed, generally the server should set DSResponse.invalidateCache to clear the cache when concurrent modification is detected. In paging mode with a partial cache, any successful "update" or "add" operation may cause client and server row numbering to become out of sync. This happens because the update may affect the sort order, and client and server cannot be guaranteed to match for sets of records that have equivalent values for the sort field. For this reason, after an "add" or "update" operation with a partial cache, the ResultSet will automatically mark cache for invalidation the next time a fetch operation is performed. Alternatively, if ResultSet.updatePartialCache is set to false, the ResultSet will simply invalidate cache immediately in this circumstance.

If the fetchMode is "paged" then the format is extended to allow the ResultTree.childCountProperty','childCountProperty to be set on folder nodes. Providing an initial set of nodes in this way does not affect the behavior of the ResultTree in its loading of unloaded folders. An equivalent result is achieved if the first fetch from the server returns this same data. If fetchMode is "paged" then you may make folder-by-folder choices as to whether to use paging for the childen of each folder. If you would like to use paging in a folder then you may include a partial list of that folder's children with the data, provided that you set the childCountProperty to the total number of children. Otherwise you will need to include either all children of the folder or none of the children. Open folders without any children provided will cause immediate, new fetches for the children, as usual.

These n records are the records at indices 0 through (n - 1) that are stored on the server under the parent node. If the childCountProperty set on the parent node indicates that there are m > n total rows under the parent node then the records at indices n to (m - 1) will be fetched from the server as the user scrolls the additional rows into view.

If the fetchMode is "paged" then the format is extended to allow the ResultTree.childCountProperty','childCountProperty to be set on folder nodes. Providing an initial set of nodes in this way does not affect the behavior of the ResultTree in its loading of unloaded folders. An equivalent result is achieved if the first fetch from the server returns this same data. If fetchMode is "paged" then you may make folder-by-folder choices as to whether to use paging for the childen of each folder. If you would like to use paging in a folder then you may include a partial list of that folder's children with the data, provided that you set the childCountProperty to the total number of children. Otherwise you will need to include either all children of the folder or none of the children. Open folders without any children provided will cause immediate, new fetches for the children, as usual.

These n records are the records at indices 0 through (n - 1) that are stored on the server under the parent node. If the childCountProperty set on the parent node indicates that there are m > n total rows under the parent node then the records at indices n to (m - 1) will be fetched from the server as the user scrolls the additional rows into view.

If set to false, then use of the placeholder attribute is disabled and an alternative technique to display the hint in-field is used instead.

Note that placeholder behavior is known to differ in Internet Explorer and certain old versions of the above browsers due to a recent change in the HTML5 specification regarding the placeholder attribute.

If set to false, then use of the placeholder attribute is disabled and an alternative technique to display the hint in-field is used instead.

Note that placeholder behavior is known to differ in Internet Explorer and certain old versions of the above browsers due to a recent change in the HTML5 specification regarding the placeholder attribute. Under the old rules, the placeholder is cleared when the element is focused. In the latest HTML5 spec as published by WHATWG, the placeholder is still displayed when the element is focused as long as the value is an empty string. <h3>Styling the placeholder</h3> While there isn't a standard way to style the placeholder text, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari provide vendor-prefixed pseudo-classes and/or pseudo-elements that can be used in CSS selectors: <table border="1"> <tr> <th>Browser</th> <th>Pseudo-class or pseudo-element</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Chrome, Safari</td> <td>::-webkit-input-placeholder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Firefox 4 - 18</td> <td>:-moz-placeholder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Firefox 19+</td> <td>::-moz-placeholder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Internet Explorer</td> <td>:-ms-input-placeholder</td> </tr> </table> Note that unlike other browsers, Firefox 19+ applies opacity:0.4 to the placeholder text. See <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=556145' target='_blank'>Bug 556145 - Placeholder text default style should use opacity instead of GrayText</a> Because browsers are required to ignore the entire rule if a selector is invalid, separate rules are needed for each browser. For example: ::-webkit-input-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1;&#125;:-moz-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1;&#125;::-moz-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1;&#125;:-ms-input-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1;&#125; If using <a href='http://sass-lang.com' target='_blank'>Sass</a>, it may be useful to utilize Sass' <a href='http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#parent-selector' target='_blank'>parent selector feature</a>.

The placeholder is intended to be a <em>short</em> hint that assists the user who is entering a value into the empty field. The placeholder can be mistaken by some users for a pre-filled value, particularly in Internet Explorer because the same color is used, and the placeholder text color may provide insufficient contrast, particularly in Firefox 19+ because of the default 0.4 opacity. Furthermore, not having a title reduces the hit area available for setting focus on the item.

Under the old rules, the placeholder is cleared when the element is focused. In the latest HTML5 spec as published by WHATWG, the placeholder is still displayed when the element is focused as long as the value is an empty string. <h3>Styling the placeholder</h3> While there isn't a standard way to style the placeholder text, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari provide vendor-prefixed pseudo-classes and/or pseudo-elements that can be used in CSS selectors: <table border="1"> <tr> <th>Browser</th> <th>Pseudo-class or pseudo-element</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Chrome, Safari</td> <td>::-webkit-input-placeholder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Firefox 4 - 18</td> <td>:-moz-placeholder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Firefox 19+</td> <td>::-moz-placeholder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Internet Explorer</td> <td>:-ms-input-placeholder</td> </tr> </table> Note that unlike other browsers, Firefox 19+ applies opacity:0.4 to the placeholder text.

For example: .myCustomItem,.myCustomItemRTL,.myCustomItemDisabled,.myCustomItemDisabledRTL,.myCustomItemError,.myCustomItemErrorRTL,.myCustomItemFocused,.myCustomItemFocusedRTL,.myCustomItemHint,.myCustomItemHintRTL,.myCustomItemDisabledHint,.myCustomItemDisabledHintRTL { // ... &amp;::-webkit-input-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1; } &amp;:-moz-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1; } &amp;::-moz-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1; } &amp;:-ms-input-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1; }&#125; If using <a href='http://compass-style.org' target='_blank'>Compass</a>, the <a href='http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/user_interface/#mixin-input-placeholder' target='_blank'>input-placeholder mixin</a> that was added in version 1.0 can further simplify the code to style the placeholder text For example: .myCustomItem,.myCustomItemRTL,.myCustomItemDisabled,.myCustomItemDisabledRTL,.myCustomItemError,.myCustomItemErrorRTL,.myCustomItemFocused,.myCustomItemFocusedRTL,.myCustomItemHint,.myCustomItemHintRTL,.myCustomItemDisabledHint,.myCustomItemDisabledHintRTL { // ... &#64;include input-placeholder { color: blue; opacity: 1; }&#125; <h3>Accessibility concerns</h3> The HTML5 specification notes that a placeholder should not be used as a replacement for a title. The placeholder is intended to be a <em>short</em> hint that assists the user who is entering a value into the empty field. The placeholder can be mistaken by some users for a pre-filled value, particularly in Internet Explorer because the same color is used, and the placeholder text color may provide insufficient contrast, particularly in Firefox 19+ because of the default 0.4 opacity. Furthermore, not having a title reduces the hit area available for setting focus on the item.

This property affects how dates are displayed and also the assumed timezone for user-input. For a concrete example - assume this method has been called and passed a value of "+01:00", and an application has a DateTimeItem visible in a DynamicForm. If the value of this field is set to the current date, with UTC time set to "10:00", the time portion of the value displayed in the form item will be "11:00". Similarly if a user modifies the time value in the text box to be "16:00", a call to FormItem.getValue for the item will return a date object with UTC time set to 15:00. Interaction with daylight savings time: The specified "defaultDisplayTimezone" should reflect the correct UTC offset for the current date, for which it will always be exactly respected; adjustment will only be made for dates that fall outside the current daylight savings time mode. In other words if DST is currently not in effect (IE: the current date is a Winter date), any other dates where DST is not in effect will be formatted to exactly respect the specified defaultDisplayTimezone (so for defaultDisplayTimezone of "+01:00", the display string will be 1 hour ahead of the UTC time on the date in question), and any dates where DST is in effect would be further adjusted to account for DST (so the display string would be 2 hours ahead for dates that fall in the Summer). Alternatively if DST currently is in effect (EG: Current date is a Summer date) the situation is reversed. Any date value for which DST should be applied will be be formatted for display with an offset of 1 hour from UTC - and any date value for which DST should not be applied would be formatted with an offset of 0 hours from UTC. Note that the Time.adjustForDST property may be set to false to disable this logic - in this case the time portion of dates will always be offset from UTC by exactly the specified defaultDisplayOffset, regardless of whether they fall in the range where Daylight Savings Time would usually be applied or not. Note that if a custom timezone is specified, it will not effect native javascript date formatting functions such as toLocaleString(). See dateFormatAndStorage for more on how SmartClient handles date and time formatting and storage. If this method is never called, the default display timezone for times and datetimes will be derived from the native browser local timezone. Note that the displayTimezone effects datetime fields only and has no effect on fields specified as logical date (field.type = "date";) or logical time (field.type = "time").

For most types of cross-field validation, you should fetch the current saved record using the server-side API DataSource.fetchById(). For example, in Velocity: $dataSource.fetchById($record.primaryKeyField).otherFieldName Note that, while a DSRequest provides dsRequest.oldValues, these values cannot be relied upon for a security check since they could be faked. Server-side custom validators also have access to the standard set of context variables that come from the Servlet API. However, be aware that if you write conditions that depend upon these variables, you preclude your Validator from being used in the widest possible variety of circumstances; for example, in a command-line process. Rather, it will be tied to operating in the context of, say, an HttpSession. Given the above caveat, the following context variables are also available: servletRequest - The associated HttpServletRequest session - The associated HttpSession httpParameters - This variable gives you access to the parameters Map of the associated HttpServletRequest; it is an alternate form of $servletRequest.getParameter requestAttributes - This variable gives you access to the attributes Map of the associated HttpServletRequest; it is an alternate form of $servletRequest.getAttribute sessionAttributes - This variable gives you access to the attributes Map of the associated HttpSession; it is an alternate form of $session.getAttribute Special considerations for Velocity To return a true or false value in Velocity, you script can either be just an expression that returns a boolean value, or the result of evaluating the Velocity template can result in output of "true" or "false". All of the following are valid forms: &nbsp;&nbsp;$value &lt; 100 &nbsp;&nbsp;$util.contains($value, "some string") &nbsp;&nbsp;$record.someField(assuming that "someField" contains a boolean value) &nbsp;&nbsp;$value &gt; $record.otherField For additional troubleshooting information when Velocity expressions aren't working as expected, set the log category org.apache.Velocity to DEBUG in log4j.isc.config.xml. Because it's tricky to call arbitrary Java methods in Velocity, the following special objects are passed to Velocity for convenience: dataSources - The list of all DataSources, accessible by name (so, for example, $dataSources.supplyItem refers to the supplyItem DataSource object). util - A com.isomorphic.util.DataTools object, giving you access to all of that class's useful helper functions

	 * A validator describes a check that should be performed on a value the user is trying to save. Validators are specified for DataSource fields via the DataSourceField.validators property. Validators that need not be run on the server can also be specified for a specific FormItem or ListGridField. SmartClient supports a powerful library of ValidatorType','ValidatorTypes which have identical behavior on both the client and the server. Beyond this, custom validators can be defined on the client and custom validation logic added on the server. Note that the regexp and mask validator types are very flexible and can be used to perform virtually any kind of formatting check that doesn't involve some large external dataset. Custom validators can be reused on the client by adding them to the global validator list, via the Validator.addValidator method.

The form current values or ListGrid record is used as reference for the criteria. If the criteria match, then the validator will be processed. Otherwise the validator is skipped and assumed valid. To use an applyWhen criteria the form or grid must use a DataSource. <strong>NOTE:</strong> applyWhen is not supported for "binary" fields. <h3>Server and client use</h3> Conditional validators are enforced both on the server and on the client-side when defined on a DataSource field as shown in the examples below.

A common use case is conditionally displaying or enabling fields. Use the readOnly validator with an applyWhen value to control the read-only appearance of a field.

If your expression is syntactically invalid, an exception is thrown and the error message is displayed in the client. See serverScript for general information on Server Scripting and JSR223, and velocitySupport for general information on Velocity support, and also see below for special rules for Velocity. Available variables The following variables are available in a serverCondition: dataSource - The current DataSource record - Other submitted values part of the same update value - The value of the field validator - The config of this validator, including all attributes declared on the &lt;validator&gt; tag, presented as a Map field - The field (as a DSField object) Note that "record" will contain only other values submitted at the same time, not the complete DataSource record. For most types of cross-field validation, you should fetch the current saved record using the server-side API DataSource.fetchById(). For example, in Velocity: $dataSource.fetchById($record.primaryKeyField).otherFieldName Note that, while a DSRequest provides dsRequest.oldValues, these values cannot be relied upon for a security check since they could be faked. Server-side custom validators also have access to the standard set of context variables that come from the Servlet API. However, be aware that if you write conditions that depend upon these variables, you preclude your Validator from being used in the widest possible variety of circumstances; for example, in a command-line process. Rather, it will be tied to operating in the context of, say, an HttpSession. Given the above caveat, the following context variables are also available: servletRequest - The associated HttpServletRequest session - The associated HttpSession httpParameters - This variable gives you access to the parameters Map of the associated HttpServletRequest; it is an alternate form of $servletRequest.getParameter requestAttributes - This variable gives you access to the attributes Map of the associated HttpServletRequest; it is an alternate form of $servletRequest.getAttribute sessionAttributes - This variable gives you access to the attributes Map of the associated HttpSession; it is an alternate form of $session.getAttribute Special considerations for Velocity To return a true or false value in Velocity, you script can either be just an expression that returns a boolean value, or the result of evaluating the Velocity template can result in output of "true" or "false". All of the following are valid forms: &nbsp;&nbsp;$value &lt; 100 &nbsp;&nbsp;$util.contains($value, "some string") &nbsp;&nbsp;$record.someField(assuming that "someField" contains a boolean value) &nbsp;&nbsp;$value &gt; $record.otherField For additional troubleshooting information when Velocity expressions aren't working as expected, set the log category org.apache.Velocity to DEBUG in log4j.isc.config.xml. Because it's tricky to call arbitrary Java methods in Velocity, the following special objects are passed to Velocity for convenience: dataSources - The list of all DataSources, accessible by name (so, for example, $dataSources.supplyItem refers to the supplyItem DataSource object). util - A com.isomorphic.util.DataTools object, giving you access to all of that class's useful helper functions

If a single logical form needs to be separated into multiple DynamicForm instances for Layout purposes (for example, spanning one logical form across multiple Tabs), a ValuesManager can be used to make the forms act as one logical form, supporting all value-related APIs otherwise called on DynamicForm directly. A ValuesManager has no visual representation - it is strictly a logical entity, and the member forms provide the user interface. You can initialize a ValuesManager with a set of member forms (by setting ValuesManager.members at init) or add and remove member forms dynamically. Calling ValuesManager.setValues on a ValuesManager will automatically route new field values to whichever member form is showing an editor for that field. Likewise, calling ValuesManager.validate will validate all member forms, and ValuesManager.saveData will initiate a save operation which aggregates values from all member forms. Like a DynamicForm, a ValuesManager can be databound by setting ValuesManager.dataSource. In this case all member forms must also be bound to the same DataSource. In general, when working with a ValuesManager and its member forms, call APIs on the ValuesManager whenever you are dealing with values that span multiple forms, and only call APIs on member forms that are specific to that form or its fields. Note that, just as a DynamicForm can track values that are not shown in any FormItem, a ValuesManager may track values for which there is no FormItem in any member form. However, when using a ValuesManager these extra values are only allowed on the ValuesManager itself. Member forms will not track values for which they do not have FormItems.

When "valueless" components like these bind to a ValuesManager, it is in order to provide their own child components with a shared valuesManager so that complex data can be displayed and edited - see DataPath for more details. For components like DynamicForm and ListGrid, which do have a set of values to manage, the component's values will subsequently be available through this valuesManager. Note on pre-existent values when the member component is a DynamicForm: If the valuesManager has a value specified for some field, for which the member form has an item, this value will be applied to the member form. This is true whether the item has a value or not. However if the member form has a value for some field, and the ValuesManager does not have a specified value for the same field, we allow the valuesManager to pick up the value from the member form. Caution: If a DynamicForm without a DataSource is passed to this method, DataBoundComponent.setDataSource will be called on that form, recreating the items from copies of the item configuration stored at the time the form was created. This means that any properties or handlers added to the items after form creation will be lost. When in doubt, set the DataSource in the form as soon as possible.
